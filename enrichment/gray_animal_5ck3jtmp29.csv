There’s a preponderance of post-post-apocalyptic science fiction unpacking lofty ideas like sentience and humanity, often set on different planets or among the stars. It has also been a standout year for supernatural horrors and thrillers, particularly ones that mix queer longing with a dose of body horror. Last but not least, it’s been a great year for kissing books set in fantastical worlds.\n\nRELATED\n\nLooking for more recs? Here are our favorite books of 2022\nSo jump in and take your pick.

Pacat\n\nCover image for Ed Park’s Same Bed Different Dreams, a split image between what looks like Earth and Mars.\nImage: Random House\nSAME BED DIFFERENT DREAMS BY ED PARK\nSame Bed Different Dreams is a remarkable achievement, and not for the faint of heart. Through three storylines, the book creates a kind of speculative history of Korea, with an emphasis on World War II and Japan’s colonial rule and aftermath (and, crucially, the United States’ involvement). One story thread builds out a hefty alternative history of the Korean Provisional Government’s role and reach. Another story thread focuses on a Black Korean War vet who wrote a sci-fi epic series called 2333, which is later adapted into a video game. And yet another story thread has a more futuristic flavor, focusing on a has-been writer who now works for a tech company called GLOAT. These threads periodically intersect — for example, GLOAT ends up owning the rights to 2333, and turns it into a kind of edutainment.\n\nIf it sounds like there’s a lot going on, it’s because there is. And it’s made even denser by the author’s Pynchonian sense of humor. Some of its best moments are utterly weird or feel like the writer was smirking — like a character’s dog who can’t stop “archiving” by burying found manuscript pages, the fact that GLOAT employees truly don’t know what the acronym stands for, or the idea that Marilyn Monroe is a member of the Korean Provisional Government. These absurd bits only make it harder to comb apart what’s real and what’s Ed Park’s “alternate history” in sections with realistic-sounding combinations of fact and fiction.\n\nIt’s got the same ambitious patchwork as Jennifer Egan’s The Candy House and Namwali Serpell’s The Old Drift. Critics have compared it to everything from David Mitchell’s Cloud Atlas to David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest. There’s also, of course, books within the book. It’s a fever dream of a thing, and one I’d heartily recommend, but perhaps with a notebook in hand or some sticky notes to help track the references. (Or perhaps, as I did, just letting the wave of information roll over you, until you’re left with a vast impression and a desire to reread.) —Nicole Clark\n\nCover image for Kylie Lee Baker’s The Scarlet Alchemist, featuring a woman in a red outfit with a large crown set against a dark skyline.\nImage: Inkyard Press\nTHE SCARLET ALCHEMIST (THE SCARLET ALCHEMIST #1) BY KYLIE LEE BAKER\nDo not go into The Scarlet Alchemist expecting typical YA fare. What Kylie Lee Baker delivers is a story of visceral brutality, interlaced with elements of Chinese history and thoughtful meditations on family, race, and belonging. It’s a book that can turn your stomach as easily as it can break your heart.\n\nSet in an alternate Tang dynasty, the novel follows Zilan, a profoundly talented young alchemist who travels to the capital in hopes of landing a coveted position in the royal service. But being a poor, half Scotian girl means the odds are stacked inordinately high against her in the imperial service exams — and that’s before her skills with the illegal art of resurrection catch the prince’s attention and pull her into a dangerous political game. While the premise seems familiar (underdog competes in trials, falls into star-crossed romance), Baker’s skills with immersive world-building, knotty characters, and genuinely gruesome horror make The Scarlet Alchemist a dazzling and singular tale that left me rushing to read her back catalog. —Sadie Gennis\n\nCover image of C Pam Zhang’s Land of Milk and Honey, featuring rollicking hills of white, blue, and yellow.\nImage: Riverhead\nLAND OF MILK AND HONEY BY C PAM ZHANG\nAfter I read How Much of These Hills is Gold in 2020, C Pam Zhang became an instant must-read author in my household. Land of Milk and Honey is entirely unlike her debut — where her debut’s language was sparse and pointed, this book is florid and indulgent — though similar in the extent to which it transported me somewhere entirely new, and more than a little threatening.\n\nIn Land of Milk and Honey the climate apocalypse has rendered fresh produce, at scale, a thing of the past — which is to say a provision of the extremely rich. The protagonist, listless and hungry, applies for a job as a private chef for a mysterious family in the Italian Alps (those who live around it call it “​​la terra di latte e miele”).

But he is a closed book. And if you think you’ve seen his hands elongate, spindly fingers yielding to piercing claws — well no, you didn’t.\n\nSlow, dreadful, and razor-sharp, Our Share of Night charts a family’s desperate attempt at escaping the clutches of a death cult in Argentina. Its members seek the secrets of immortality, and many are willing to pay any price to obtain it. Set in 1981, the novel’s supernatural terrors intertwine with those of the Dirty War, the authoritarian violence offering cover for the cult to operate uninhibited.\n\nI will read anything Mariana Enríquez writes next, it’s an absolute joy to experience her work. —N. Clark\n\nCover image for Annalee Newitz’s The Terraformers, which features a futuristic cityscape with lush greenery.\nImage: Tor Books\nTHE TERRAFORMERS BY ANNALEE NEWITZ\nThe Terraformers concerns itself with one question: As a species evolves, what behaviors stick around? Set more than 50,000 years in the future (yes, you read that number right), The Terraformers details the process of terraforming and developing a privatized planet into a tourism joint for the super rich. Technology has advanced in barely fathomable ways, allowing, for instance, the extension of human-level intelligence to animals and robots. But some aspects of society might seem familiar: Real estate developers who jack up rent with no warning? Local governments that abhor public transit? That every video call still has one person who can’t get the camera to work?\n\nEqual parts prescient and absurd, The Terraformers splits its story over three novellas, each 700 years apart. One of those stars a sentient train who teams up with an investigative journalist ... who also happens to be a cat ... who’s also trying to prove this ostensibly privatized planet is in fact public land. Written by a leading science journalist of our era (author Annalee Newitz is the founder of io9 and has written for basically every major science publication under our sun), The Terraformers is unexpectedly one of the most accurate representations of the journalistic process I’ve ever read. And it all culminates in an undeniable stance: That capitalistic power must still be held in check by the truth. Even 50,000 years in the future, a free press is among society’s most essential facets. The more things change... —Ari Notis\n\nThe cover image of Adrian Tchaikovsky’s Children of Memory, which depicts a spaceship approaching a large orange planet.\nImage: Orbit\nCHILDREN OF MEMORY (CHILDREN OF TIME #3) BY ADRIAN TCHAIKOVSKY\nAdrian Tchaikovsky’s highly anticipated third book in the Children of Time trilogy once again delves into some of science fiction’s headiest topics. There are parallels to earlier installments — Tchaikovsky once again uses another hyper-intelligent animal species to examine the idea of what being “alive” really means. But he also takes readers somewhere completely and utterly new, outside the scope of the previous titles, and incredibly difficult to describe without spoiling the premise entirely.\n\nAll I can say is hold on for the ride. This is an author who dives head first into Asimov-esque ideas, and who is willing to take the plot in fanciful directions. I still can’t believe that I have recommended a book about sentient spider colonies to so many friends, but here we are. This finale is worth your time. —N.

Huang\nYork University\njhuang@yorku.ca\nAbstract\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmerges retrieval methods with deep learning\nadvancements to address the static limitations\nof large language models (LLMs) by enabling\nthe dynamic integration of up-to-date external\ninformation. This methodology, focusing\nprimarily on the text domain, provides a\ncost-effective solution to the generation of\nplausible but incorrect responses by LLMs,\nthereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability\nof their outputs through the use of real-world\ndata. As RAG grows in complexity and\nincorporates multiple concepts that can\ninfluence its performance, this paper organizes\nthe RAG paradigm into four categories:\npre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and\ngeneration, offering a detailed perspective\nfrom the retrieval viewpoint. It outlines\nRAG’s evolution and discusses the field’s\nprogression through the analysis of significant\nstudies. Additionally, the paper introduces\nevaluation methods for RAG, addressing\nthe challenges faced and proposing future\nresearch directions. By offering an organized\nframework and categorization, the study\naims to consolidate existing research on\nRAG, clarify its technological underpinnings,\nand highlight its potential to broaden the\nadaptability and applications of LLMs.\n1 Introduction\nThe advent of ChatGPT has significantly impacted\nboth academia and industry due to its interactive\ncapabilities and widespread application, establishing itself as a leading artificial intelligence tool\n(Laskar et al., 2023; Jahan et al., 2023; Huang\nand Huang, 2024). At the core of ChatGPT is the\nlarge language model (LLM) GPT-4, as detailed by\n(OpenAI et al., 2023), which has seen numerous\nenhancements to its predecessors, showcasing exceptional abilities in a variety of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tasks (Laskar et al., 2020). Despite these advancements, the adoption of LLMs\nFigure 1: An example of RAG benefits ChatGPT resolves questions that cannot be answered beyond the\nscope of the training data and generates correct results.\nhas highlighted several critical issues primarily due\nto their reliance on extensive datasets.

This visual technique also highlights the stark contrast between the family's hidden acts of generosity and the prevailing inhumanity around them, setting them apart from the normalcy of the oppressive environment depicted by the film .","","[{""content"":""But interestingly, these scenes are in infrared, or negative, although only as long as the girl is in the outside world. As soon as she returns home, the visuals turn normal, then switch to infrared when she or her mother step out on the balcony. The family is revealed to be Polish locals who have no interest in Nazi ideals and dream of liberation one day. However, the mere fact that the family is still alive, irrespective of whether they are Jewish or not, suggests that they also have to work as collaborators for the Nazis to a certain degree. This was definitely the case with numerous non-Jews during the Nazi occupation who had to work for the horrific authorities despite not wanting to. Going by that logic, the significance of the use of infrared might be in stating how the family cannot be themselves as soon as they step out of their house or into the open balcony as well. Although the girl takes on the dangerous responsibility of helping the prisoners, she still cannot express her true self in public, leading to her being shown in infrared.

Therefore, in a film like this, in which the Nazis and the enablers are the “normal” people, anyone with any sense of humanity has to be visually differentiated from the Hoss family members.\n\nWhat Happens To Rudolf Hoss?\nDuring The Zone of Interest‘s ending, Rudolf is seen in his Berlin office as he telephones Hedwig and tells her about his excitement for the concentration camps being built. Rudolf had been given the responsibility of overseeing a new Nazi order in which Hungarian Jews were to be arrested and killed. Although Hedwig refuses to be part of this very direct talk of violence, for she prefers such matters to be in the background, the commander still feels thrilled. He is seen walking down the stairs from his office when suddenly bouts of violent retching hit him on two occasions. In the middle of these two instances, The Zone of Interest briefly moves to modern times, and various reminders of the Holocaust are seen being maintained at the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, right before the place is opened to public visitors. The last scene returns to the past once more, and Rudolf is seen feeling slightly odd, as if someone is watching him, as he continues down the stairs.\n\nThe Zone of Interest‘s ending scene seems to suggest that deep in his conscience, Rudolf Hoss does know that his actions can only make one retch, and almost like a fortune-teller, he has an uneasy feeling that his legacy will go down terribly in history. The scene of the museum is a fast jolt back to the right perspective, which had been missing throughout the film. Throughout the entire duration of The Zone of Interest, Rudolf, his family, and his professional associates had all been extremely invested in hiding the evidence and changing the narrative, but ultimately, the thousands of shoes or the torn, ragged uniforms still exist as reminders of the horrible genocide.\""\n10,https://www.loonyparty.com/about/policy-proposals/,\""manicfesto proposals\n26m tonnes of waste plastic bottles are discarded every year in the UK of which only 45% are recycled.

[note 2]\n\nSometime before the events of the game, Enver Gortash and the Dark Urge captured the Emperor, and brought it back under the thrall of the Moonrise Elder Brain, who was now wearing the Crown of Karsus and had become the Netherbrain masquerading as the Absolute. The Netherbrain, sought to have all three Chosen of the Dead Three killed, and specifically picked the Emperor, unbeknown to it, to lead a team of illithids on a nautiloid to search for and steal from the Githyanki the Astral Prism containing their prince, Orpheus.[2]\nEvents of Baldur's Gate 3\nAct Two finale\nMain article: Help Your Protector\nOn the way to Baldur's Gate, the party will be ambushed by a group of Gish'ra warriors while resting at Wyrm's Lookout. Entering the portal to the Astral Prism, the party will hear their Dream Guardian calling out for help. However, when the party reaches them, it is only to discover that the true identity of their visitor is the illithid known as the Emperor.\n\nAfter defending the Emperor, it will explain how it used the power of the Prism and Orpheus to protect the party from the Absolute, and recite to the party its history as an adventurer and finding freedom from the Absolute. The Emperor will offer the party an Astral Touched Tadpole, which causes the user to transform into a partial-illithid. It insists the path of the mind flayer is preferable, regardless of the player's view on them.\n\nThough this may seen contradictory to its previous promise as the Dream Guardian; to ensure the party do not become mind flayers, this promise refers to the player becoming a mind flayer unwillingly because of the Elder Brain. The Emperor is in favour of the player becoming a mind flayer of their own volition and without the influence of the Elder Brain.\n\nAct Three\nElfsong Tavern\nMain article: Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout\nAs the party nears the Elfsong, the Emperor will remark that the tavern is the location of its old hideout. The hideout proper is in the basement, past the Knights of the Shield's hideout. In it, the player will find various sentimental knick knacks from the Emperor's previous life, before becoming an illithid.\n\nAround the room is its old dog Rascal's collar, its favourite recipe (fiddlehead soup), its first adventuring sword, and part of a cutlery set from its mother; the butter knife having been lost during its last shipwreck on the Isle of Balduran, inside the wreck of the Wandering Eye ship.\n\nThere are also some more illithid-adequate items such as chains for its preferred prey - allegedly criminals and lawbreakers - and jars for brains.\n\nThe Wyrmway\nSee also: Wyrmway and The Blade of Frontiers\nOnce the party completes the Wyrmway trials, they will find the corpse of Ansur the Dragon.

Furthermore, he explains that while the Emperor initially did not want to become a mind flayer, it eventually fully embraced its new form, and its comfort with this caused a rift between the Emperor and Ansur. After \""\""exhausting all possibility of reversing (the Emperor's) condition\""\"", Ansur was agonizing and the Emperor (as seen in the letter on Ansur's body) attempted to convince him to leave. Ansur then attempted to murder the Emperor during its sleep as a mercy killing, and the Emperor killed Ansur in self-defense.\n\nThis development is somewhat foreshadowed when the player first meets The Emperor in their true form, as the song that plays during the encounter is a variation of The Elf Song, which prominently features Balduran in its lyrics.\nEndings\nIco knownSpells lvl 03.png Act 3 Spoilers!

Should the player allow it to wield the Netherstones, it will follow through on destroying the Elder Brain, at the cost of letting it \""\""assimilate\""\"" with Orpheus.\nIf the player suggests to the Emperor to take control of the Netherbrain, it will mention that the thought of becoming the Absolute did cross its mind. But unless otherwise persuaded, it will refuse, claiming that whoever becomes the leader of the Cult of the Absolute will be in an open war with the Githyanki, which is a war it is not certain it will survive.

1. He re-edits Alan's manuscript, ""Return,"" turning it into a horror story that begins to manifest in reality  <sup>1</sup> .
2. Scratch searches for the Clicker, a crucial item needed both to fully unleash and to potentially defeat the malevolent Dark Presence  <sup>1</sup> .

5. Scratch returns to possessing Alan, and is involved in the ongoing battle that sees him shot with a Bullet of Light, which supposedly kills him  <sup>1</sup> .","","[{""content"":""Along the way, Alan also encountered Breaker, who was searching for the talk show host, Warlin Door, believing him to be responsible for trapping him in the Dark Place. Alan also occasionally made brief contact with Saga, the two of them trading vital information when they could. After believing he had killed Tom Zane, who had gone insane from his captivity inside the Dark Place, Alan was contacted by an alternative version of himself, explaining that his repeated attempts to escape the Dark Place are causing him to experience time loops.\n\nBack in the present, Alan explains that he wrote a new novel, \""\""Return\""\"", that helped him escape the Dark Place. However, Scratch re-edited the manuscript into a horror story now taking effect in reality. Alan warns that Scratch is searching for the Clicker, which is the key he needs to free the malevolent Dark Presence completely, but also the key to permanently defeating it. When one of the manuscript pages mentioning the Cult of the Tree possesses the Clicker, Saga decides to follow its trail in Watery and realizes that \""\""Return\""\"" has rewritten her past so that her daughter Logan drowned in an accident. Angered that Alan wrote her and Logan into his story, Saga recovers the Clicker, but before she can get it to Alan, agents from the FBC led by Agent Kiran Estevez arrive and apprehend him as well as the Cult leaders, revealed to be town entrepreneurs Ilmo and Jaakko Koskela.\n\nWith no other options, Saga goes to the Valhalla Nursing Home and tracks down Odin and Tor Anderson, who know more about the Clicker. As she communicates with them and rescues Tor from a Taken Cynthia Weaver, she learns that Odin and Tor are actually her grand-uncle and grandfather, respectively, and she inherited their seer abilities, allowing her to discern the changes to reality \""\""Return\""\"" is causing. Odin and Tor also explain that the Clicker does not do anything by itself, but instead dramatically enhances the creative power of the person using it, which is why it is important to Alan and Scratch. Saga then heads back to Bright Falls to get the Clicker to Alan, but finds out that the Alan who escaped Cauldron Lake was actually Scratch. With his identity now exposed, Scratch kills Jaakko and escapes from captivity, attempting to take the Clicker from Saga. He is temporarily thwarted and banished by the FBC.\n\nIlmo reveals that he and Jakko formed the cult in order to scare townsfolk away from the dangers of the lake, while they perform their ritual killings on whatever Taken emerges from it, such as Nightingale. Realizing that Alan is still trapped in the Dark Place, Saga enlists the help of Casey, Odin, Tor, and Estevez to carry out a ritual to summon him to the real world. Meanwhile, Alan continues to try and find a way out of the Dark Place, eventually making his way to his old apartment. There, he discovers his wife Alice had been tormented with visions of Scratch, eventually leading to her apparent suicide. In anger, Alan kills who he believes is Scratch, but is actually a version of himself attempting to fix Scratch's ending of \""\""Return\""\"", perpetuating the loop.\n\nBack in the real world, the summoning ritual fails to summon Alan in the current time and instead was responsible for his initial appearance earlier in the story. Both Saga and Alan come to the realization that Alan and Scratch were always the same person, with Scratch being Alan, who is possessed by the Dark Presence at the end of every loop, and thus indirectly responsible for Alice's death. Scratch arrives at the summoning site and Saga is able to banish him from Alan's body, only for Scratch to possess Casey instead, steal the Clicker, and throw Saga into the Dark Place.\n\nWith Scratch in possession of the Clicker, Alan concludes that the only way to stop him now is to find the manuscript and write a completely new ending for \""\""Return\""\"". He returns to his writing room and tries to work out how to write a perfect ending that saves everybody while staying consistent with the horror genre. Meanwhile, trapped in her mind place, Saga fights off the Dark Presence's attempt to overwhelm her with her own negative emotions and self-doubt. Now in the Dark Place proper, she reunites with Breaker, who remains there in his search for Door, heavily implied to be Saga's missing father. She then receives aid from an anonymous woman who directs her to the Clicker and a Bullet of Light. Saga takes the two items and escapes back to the real world by mimicking Door's actions on a manuscript page given to her by Breaker. With the Clicker, Alan is able to banish Scratch from Casey's body. Scratch returns to possessing Alan, and Saga shoots him with the Bullet of Light, seemingly killing him and Scratch. As Casey recovers from his possession, Saga tries to call Logan to confirm her safety, but the scene cuts short before any answer can be heard.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, a recording left behind by Alice reveals that she had managed to fully regain her memories of what happened to Alan after consulting with the FBC at the Oldest House. She had tricked Alan into thinking she committed suicide by choosing to return the Dark Place as part of a plan to help him eventually escape, explaining that the only way he can escape the loops is through \""\""ascension.\""\"" Alan then revives from his gunshot wound and says, \""\""It's not a loop, it's a spiral.\""\""\n\nIn the \""\""Final Draft\""\"" ending, Alan realizes that the Bullet of Light was meant to cleanse a part of himself the Dark Presence used to create Scratch, finally killing his doppelgänger for good while finishing the spiral and freeing Alan from the loop. Saga's call connects, confirming Logan's survival, and Alan revives soon after to the surprise of her and Casey, declaring himself the master of not just two worlds, but many.\n\nChapter List\nThe chapters/parts listed here are played in the following order:\nPrologue: The Cult\nReturn 1: Invitation\nReturn 2: The Heart\nInitiation 1: Late Night\nInitiation 2: Casey\nInitiation 3: Haunting\n"",""title"":""documents.txt"",""url"":""https://mmaihub04storagefvye.blob.core.windows.net/fileupload-documents/documents.txt"",""filepath"":""documents.txt"",""chunk_id"":""0"",""id"":""1""}]"

One of those stars a sentient train who teams up with an investigative journalist ... who also happens to be a cat ... who’s also trying to prove this ostensibly privatized planet is in fact public land. Written by a leading science journalist of our era (author Annalee Newitz is the founder of io9 and has written for basically every major science publication under our sun), The Terraformers is unexpectedly one of the most accurate representations of the journalistic process I’ve ever read. And it all culminates in an undeniable stance: That capitalistic power must still be held in check by the truth. Even 50,000 years in the future, a free press is among society’s most essential facets. The more things change... —Ari Notis\n\nThe cover image of Adrian Tchaikovsky’s Children of Memory, which depicts a spaceship approaching a large orange planet.\nImage: Orbit\nCHILDREN OF MEMORY (CHILDREN OF TIME #3) BY ADRIAN TCHAIKOVSKY\nAdrian Tchaikovsky’s highly anticipated third book in the Children of Time trilogy once again delves into some of science fiction’s headiest topics. There are parallels to earlier installments — Tchaikovsky once again uses another hyper-intelligent animal species to examine the idea of what being “alive” really means. But he also takes readers somewhere completely and utterly new, outside the scope of the previous titles, and incredibly difficult to describe without spoiling the premise entirely.\n\nAll I can say is hold on for the ride. This is an author who dives head first into Asimov-esque ideas, and who is willing to take the plot in fanciful directions. I still can’t believe that I have recommended a book about sentient spider colonies to so many friends, but here we are. This finale is worth your time. —N.

Huang\nYork University\njhuang@yorku.ca\nAbstract\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmerges retrieval methods with deep learning\nadvancements to address the static limitations\nof large language models (LLMs) by enabling\nthe dynamic integration of up-to-date external\ninformation. This methodology, focusing\nprimarily on the text domain, provides a\ncost-effective solution to the generation of\nplausible but incorrect responses by LLMs,\nthereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability\nof their outputs through the use of real-world\ndata. As RAG grows in complexity and\nincorporates multiple concepts that can\ninfluence its performance, this paper organizes\nthe RAG paradigm into four categories:\npre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and\ngeneration, offering a detailed perspective\nfrom the retrieval viewpoint. It outlines\nRAG’s evolution and discusses the field’s\nprogression through the analysis of significant\nstudies. Additionally, the paper introduces\nevaluation methods for RAG, addressing\nthe challenges faced and proposing future\nresearch directions. By offering an organized\nframework and categorization, the study\naims to consolidate existing research on\nRAG, clarify its technological underpinnings,\nand highlight its potential to broaden the\nadaptability and applications of LLMs.\n1 Introduction\nThe advent of ChatGPT has significantly impacted\nboth academia and industry due to its interactive\ncapabilities and widespread application, establishing itself as a leading artificial intelligence tool\n(Laskar et al., 2023; Jahan et al., 2023; Huang\nand Huang, 2024). At the core of ChatGPT is the\nlarge language model (LLM) GPT-4, as detailed by\n(OpenAI et al., 2023), which has seen numerous\nenhancements to its predecessors, showcasing exceptional abilities in a variety of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tasks (Laskar et al., 2020). Despite these advancements, the adoption of LLMs\nFigure 1: An example of RAG benefits ChatGPT resolves questions that cannot be answered beyond the\nscope of the training data and generates correct results.\nhas highlighted several critical issues primarily due\nto their reliance on extensive datasets. This reliance\nrestricts their ability to incorporate new information post-training, leading to three primary challenges. First, the focus on broad and general data\nto maximize accessibility and applicability results\nin subpar performance in specialized areas.
