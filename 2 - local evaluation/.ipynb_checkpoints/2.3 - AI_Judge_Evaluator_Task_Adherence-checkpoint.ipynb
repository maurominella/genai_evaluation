    "This sample demonstrates to how to use task adherence evaluator on agent data. The supported input formats include:\n",
    "- simple data such as strings;\n",
    "- user-agent conversations in the form of list of agent messages. \n",

    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 10 minutes running this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "For quality evaluation, you need to deploy a `gpt` model supporting JSON mode. We recommend a model `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini` for their strong reasoning capabilities.    \n",
