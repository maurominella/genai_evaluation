    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample demonstrates how to use Response Completeness Evaluator on agent's response when ground truth is provided. This evaluator is helpful when you have ground truth to assess the quality of the agent's final response. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 20 minutes running this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "For quality evaluation, you need to deploy a `gpt` model supporting JSON mode. We recommend a model `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini` for their strong reasoning capabilities.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity azure-ai-evaluation\n",
    "```\n",
    "Set these environment variables with your own values:\n",
    "1) **PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING** - The project connection string, as found in the overview page of your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "2) **MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME** - The deployment name of the model for this AI-assisted evaluator, as found under the \"Name\" column in the \"Models + endpoints\" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "3) **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT** - Azure Open AI Endpoint to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "4) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY** - Azure Open AI Key to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "5) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION** - Azure Open AI Api version to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "6) **AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID** - Azure Subscription Id of Azure AI Project\n",
    "7) **PROJECT_NAME** - Azure AI Project Name\n",
    "8) **RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME** - Azure AI Project Resource Group Name\n"
