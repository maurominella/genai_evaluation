I need to deliver a deep dive training on Azure AI Evaluation Framework.
The first part concerns the explanation of the following key metrics:
1: Intent Resolution
2: Tool Call Accuracy
3: Task Adherence
4: Response Completeness
5: Groundedness (prompt-based)
6: Groundedness Pro
7: Retrieval
8: Relevance
9: Coherence
10: Fluency
11: Similarity
12: F1 Score
13: BLEU Score
14: ROUGE Score
15: METEOR Score

I'm now passing you a json dictionary that contains the following keys:
1) metric_name, which contains the metric name
2) metric_definition, that defines the metric
3) metric_features, that contains a list of information about that metric

I need you provide me with one example for each of the possible grades (from the highest to the lowest).
For example:
- if the score range goes from 1 to 5 where 1 is the lowest quality and 5 is the highest quality, please provide five answers for grades 5-4-3-2-1.
- if the score range is a float [0-1] (higher means better quality), please provide just 3-4 answers e.g. for 0.9, 0.5 and 0.2.

Here is the informatio to provide for each example:
QUESTION: a sample question
ANSWER: an answer to that question
SCORE: the metric score
EXPLANATION: the reason of that quite low score

RULES
The **MOST IMPORTANT RULE** is that my students clearly understand the difference between each metric. So please do **NOT** provide generic examples that could be used for **ANY** metric, but really **SPECIFIC** for the metric I asked you.
QUESTION and ANSWER must be less than 50 words each.
QUESTION, ANSWER, SCORE AND  EXPLANATION must be in French.
