It’s been another banner year for science fiction and fantasy books. Many of our favorites once again blur the line between sci-fi and fantasy, but this year was a particular standout for books blurring the line between SFF and other genres. This includes everything from historical fiction — both speculative histories and Westerns — to fable retellings to intergenerational sagas in translation.

Though we seem to have crested the wave of pandemic novels, that sense of dread and discoloration has lingered, written into novels of new forms. There’s a preponderance of post-post-apocalyptic science fiction unpacking lofty ideas like sentience and humanity, often set on different planets or among the stars. It has also been a standout year for supernatural horrors and thrillers, particularly ones that mix queer longing with a dose of body horror. Last but not least, it’s been a great year for kissing books set in fantastical worlds.

SAME BED DIFFERENT DREAMS BY ED PARK
Same Bed Different Dreams is a remarkable achievement, and not for the faint of heart. Through three storylines, the book creates a kind of speculative history of Korea, with an emphasis on World War II and Japan’s colonial rule and aftermath (and, crucially, the United States’ involvement). One story thread builds out a hefty alternative history of the Korean Provisional Government’s role and reach. Another story thread focuses on a Black Korean War vet who wrote a sci-fi epic series called 2333, which is later adapted into a video game. And yet another story thread has a more futuristic flavor, focusing on a has-been writer who now works for a tech company called GLOAT. These threads periodically intersect — for example, GLOAT ends up owning the rights to 2333, and turns it into a kind of edutainment.

If it sounds like there’s a lot going on, it’s because there is. And it’s made even denser by the author’s Pynchonian sense of humor. Some of its best moments are utterly weird or feel like the writer was smirking — like a character’s dog who can’t stop “archiving” by burying found manuscript pages, the fact that GLOAT employees truly don’t know what the acronym stands for, or the idea that Marilyn Monroe is a member of the Korean Provisional Government. These absurd bits only make it harder to comb apart what’s real and what’s Ed Park’s “alternate history” in sections with realistic-sounding combinations of fact and fiction.

It’s got the same ambitious patchwork as Jennifer Egan’s The Candy House and Namwali Serpell’s The Old Drift. Critics have compared it to everything from David Mitchell’s Cloud Atlas to David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest. There’s also, of course, books within the book. It’s a fever dream of a thing, and one I’d heartily recommend, but perhaps with a notebook in hand or some sticky notes to help track the references. (Or perhaps, as I did, just letting the wave of information roll over you, until you’re left with a vast impression and a desire to reread.) —Nicole Clark

THE SCARLET ALCHEMIST (THE SCARLET ALCHEMIST #1) BY KYLIE LEE BAKER
Do not go into The Scarlet Alchemist expecting typical YA fare. What Kylie Lee Baker delivers is a story of visceral brutality, interlaced with elements of Chinese history and thoughtful meditations on family, race, and belonging. It’s a book that can turn your stomach as easily as it can break your heart.

Set in an alternate Tang dynasty, the novel follows Zilan, a profoundly talented young alchemist who travels to the capital in hopes of landing a coveted position in the royal service. But being a poor, half Scotian girl means the odds are stacked inordinately high against her in the imperial service exams — and that’s before her skills with the illegal art of resurrection catch the prince’s attention and pull her into a dangerous political game. While the premise seems familiar (underdog competes in trials, falls into star-crossed romance), Baker’s skills with immersive world-building, knotty characters, and genuinely gruesome horror make The Scarlet Alchemist a dazzling and singular tale that left me rushing to read her back catalog. —Sadie Gennis

LAND OF MILK AND HONEY BY C PAM ZHANG
After I read How Much of These Hills is Gold in 2020, C Pam Zhang became an instant must-read author in my household. Land of Milk and Honey is entirely unlike her debut — where her debut’s language was sparse and pointed, this book is florid and indulgent — though similar in the extent to which it transported me somewhere entirely new, and more than a little threatening.

In Land of Milk and Honey the climate apocalypse has rendered fresh produce, at scale, a thing of the past — which is to say a provision of the extremely rich. The protagonist, listless and hungry, applies for a job as a private chef for a mysterious family in the Italian Alps (those who live around it call it “​​la terra di latte e miele”). While there, she unravels the family’s true intentions, while making them delicious meals from rare ingredients.

Zhang sensuously describes all pleasures of the tongue, moving from descriptions of lapping of culinary delicacies to the folds of the flesh. Food feels hyperreal, with an emphasis on the texture and taste of every ingredient — and sometimes the cruelty of that ingredient’s procurement. The same can be said of its scenes depicting queer intimacy; that texture and taste take precedent, and the cruelties of human emotion, too. Even after I finished, I was hungry for more. —N. Clark

Cover image for Megan Kamalei Kakimoto’s Every Drop is a Man’s Nightmare, featuring a red and yellow flower against a painted backdrop.

EVERY DROP IS A MAN’S NIGHTMARE BY MEGAN KAMALEI KAKIMOTO
This short story collection initially caught my attention with its cover, which depicts a woman springing up from the center of a corpse flower, like a stalk standing against the wind. Each story weaves together Hawaiian mythology and the everyday lives of the Hawaiian and mixed-race Japanese women who live there.

These stories range from fabulism to science fiction, all speculative fiction in their own way. In one story, a woman’s encounter with a wild pig ends up foreshadowing a complicated pregnancy later in her life. In another story, a Brazilian waxing company allows people to pay for hairless skin by giving up personality traits. In another story, the narrator falls for a woman who lives with her family — in one of numerous queer stories in the collection — but has to cope with that woman’s decision to return to “what remains of Kaua’i” and join their protests.

The author’s own words, published in The Guardian, sum it up best: “There is a mythical idealisation of the islands of Hawaii as paradise, peace in the tropics; some even call it a modern utopia. Yet this flattening of Hawaii to a postcard image divests our homeland of its culture and colour, reducing us to a place and history that is easily digestible. But we are not easily digestible, and our stories are not meant to be easy for you.” —N. Clark

HE WHO DROWNED THE WORLD (THE RADIANT EMPEROR #2) BY SHELLEY PARKER-CHAN
An alternate history of the founding of the Ming dynasty, He Who Drowned the World shifts between four tragically ambitious figures willing to pay any price to materialize their destiny, whether that’s revenge on the empire or crowning themselves the ruler of it. They pursue these goals with unshakeable inertia, doing endlessly cruel and sadistic actions with only the occasional doubts as to whether happiness could be possible if they chose a different path.

This is a relentlessly brutal sequel, and there’s a hopelessness that weighs heavy throughout the book. But Parker-Chan’s penetrating ability to bring empathy and nuance into even the darkest corners of humanity sparks an undeniable connection with these characters, whose self-destructive natures would otherwise be too hard to bear witness to. He Who Drowned the World is a dark and difficult read, yet Parker-Chan’s prose is so brilliant, her character work so complex, that I still found myself sad to leave this world behind. —SG

LABYRINTH’S HEART (ROOK & ROSE #3) BY M.A. CARRICK
One of my favorite fantasy series of the past five years, Rook & Rose is an intricately layered trilogy where there are so many secrets, schemes, and conspiracies that at times it’s admittedly difficult to keep track of them all. Because of that, there were a lot of loose ends to tie up in the anticipated conclusion, Labyrinth’s Heart. (Ren alone was juggling four different identities at the novel’s start.) So imagine my surprise when I discovered M.A. Carrick not only managed to leave no question unanswered by the series’ end, but wrapped up even the most complicated storylines in big, bright bows.

There are elements of Labyrinth’s Heart that feel like they were precisely crafted to cater to fans, but here’s the thing: I don’t really care. Carrick created such a lush world populated by lovable characters, an interesting magic system, and a lived-in cultural history that I was just happy to be back in Nadežra after a two-year wait. While things may have been tied up a bit too neatly for my usual tastes, that didn’t stop me from whipping through pages and smiling the whole way through. Sometimes it’s nice to simply soak in a happy ending rather than bathe in the bittersweet. —SG

MISTER MAGIC BY KIERSTEN WHITE
The latest fantasy-with-an-irresistible-pop-premise from the author of Hide, Mister Magic revolves around a children’s TV show no viewer can forget … or prove it ever existed in the first place. There are no official records of it, no YouTube videos or merchandise or passed-around VHS tapes, and any discussion of it on the internet rapidly disappears. But the people who remember seeing it are convinced the special effects were remarkably vivid and realistic. They agree the central concept is unnerving: a creepy magician-figure leading a group of children in imagination-games aimed at teaching some decidedly non-standard lessons about embracing conformity and meekness. And they’re all sure that something horrible happened while they were watching, though they can’t agree on what.

A reunion between five of the former child cast members, taking place 30 years after the show ended, slowly unravels its mysteries, which are even weirder than the description above suggests. Mister Magic is a startling dark fantasy with a lot of foreboding, foreshadowing, and eerie twists. At heart, though, it’s also an incisive story about the kinds of people who revel in control over other people’s lives, and about what an act of rebellion imagination can be. —Tasha Robinson

THE MUSEUM OF HUMAN HISTORY BY REBEKAH BERGMAN
A poetic reflection on memory, loss, and connection, The Museum of Human History is a stunning debut reminiscent of the work of Emily St. John Mandel. Slipping backward and forward in time, this introspective mosaic weaves between an identical twin whose sister fell asleep at age 8 and has never aged in the 25 years since, a museum director who questions his place within the family legacy, a widower who lost his most cherished memories as a result of an anti-aging treatment, and others equally struggling with the passage of time. There is a lyrical detachment in Bergman’s prose that leaves you feeling like you’re watching events unfold through a pane of thick glass, never fully able to connect with the characters, yet you remain helplessly transfixed by the haunting cycle they’re caught in. It’s an incredibly melancholy book, but the kind of aching sadness you’re happy to sink into. —SG

THE JASAD HEIR (THE SCORCHED THRONE #1) BY SARA HASHEM
“Arin of Nizahl was maddeningly elegant. I wanted to cut him open and compare our bones to understand why his gave him grace and mine gave me back pain.” This was the line that absolutely sold me on The Jasad Heir, an irresistible enemies-to-lovers fantasy that reminded me why I’ll never quit this genre.

Headstrong Sylvia is the presumed dead heir of Jasad, a kingdom that was destroyed by the neighboring Nizahl and saw its citizens’ innate magic outlawed. Sylvia managed to carve out a relatively normal life for herself as a chemist’s apprentice, but everything falls apart after she accidentally reveals her magic to the heir of Nizahl. Using her life as leverage, the calculating Arin strikes a deal with Sylvia to help him capture a group of Jasadi rebels and act as his champion in a series of deadly trials. It’s a familiar setup, but one impeccably done by Hashem, who delivers sharp political intrigue, sparkling banter, and touching friendships on top of Sylvia and Arin’s simmering romance. —SG

THE SURVIVING SKY (THE RAGES TRILOGY #1) BY KRITIKA H. RAO
After I finished The Surviving Sky, I wouldn’t shut up about it and tried (not always successfully) to get everyone I know to read it. So let me try once more, and maybe with less yelling this time:

With the planet’s surface made unlivable by catastrophic storms, the remains of humanity survive on floating cities constructed of and powered by plants that only a select group of people, known as architects, can control. An archeologist without the ability to traject plants, Ahilya has dedicated her life to finding a way to unshackle humanity’s survival from the architects’ powers and return to the surface. It’s not hard to see why this mission causes friction in her marriage to Iravan, one of the most powerful architects in their city, and one with an arrogance to match his revered status. Though estranged, Ahilya and Iravan come together to help clear his name after he’s accused of pushing his powers dangerously far, an accusation, which if proved true, carries dire consequences for the architect.

But the deeper they look into trajection and its risks, the more Ahilya and Iravan realize they don’t actually know much about where their people – and their powers – came from. And as the floating cities begin to sink toward the earthrages below, the race to save their civilization may also be the end of society as it stands, as Ahilya and Iravan uncover long-buried truths that previous generations worked hard to keep hidden.

So did I do it? Did I convince you to read this Hindu philosophy-inspired debut with some of the most inventive world-building and one of the most complex romances I’ve read in years? Please say yes. You’ll be doing us both a favor. —SG

THE COMBAT CODES AND GRIEVAR’S BLOOD (THE COMBAT CODES SAGA #1-2) BY ALEXANDER DARWIN
In the world of The Combat Codes, war no longer exists as it used to. Neither does justice — both concepts have been replaced by proxies who fight on behalf of nations or individuals, solving disputes with their fists.

Alexander Darwin’s debut novel effectively builds a world around this core concept, bringing it to life with compelling characters and locations (including a classic “magical school for gifted youngsters” situation). The Combat Codes follows Cego, a young abandoned boy skilled at fighting, and Murray, a washed-up former fighter now tasked with scouting the next generation of combatants, whose discovery of Cego changes his entire world.

Darwin is also a Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner and teacher, and uses that experience in the books’ excellent fight sequences. His evocative and visceral descriptions not only deliver excitement and suspense in this underdog story; they build your understanding of the characters through how they fight. The Combat Codes and its equally fun sequel, Grievar’s Blood, which adds new exciting characters and points-of-view, are the first two parts of a planned trilogy, and I can’t wait for the conclusion next year. —Pete Volk

MY MURDER BY KATIE WILLIAMS
Fans of Sarah Gailey’s The Echo Wife won’t want to miss My Murder, which shares some key elements and themes with Gailey’s novel while also taking them in a unique direction. In a near-future with only a few light sci-fi elements, Lou has been resurrected along with a handful of other women murdered by a single serial killer. The politics of resurrection in her world are complicated, and few people qualify. That leaves her and her fellow victims (whose therapy circle recalls Grady Hendrix’s The Final Girl Support Group) a bit at sea as they try to come to terms with their deaths, which none of them can recall, and their new lives as celebrities for all the wrong reasons.

Like The Echo Wife, My Murder ends up thoughtfully exploring issues around women subjected to violent men — not just the personal and internal response, but the society that shapes that violence, and responds to it in ways that raise endless questions. The victims all respond to their deaths differently, questioning their culpability and the possible failures that might have made them targets, and navigating their families’ unpredictable responses to their revival. There’s one big mystery at the heart of My Murder, and a whole lot of abrupt and compelling surprises. But at the core, it’s a sci-fi twist on the survivor story, letting some very different people explore what it means to be victimized, and how to reclaim the lives that have been abruptly handed back to them. —TR

Cover image for Ann Leckie’s Translation State, a minimalist drawing with red, orange, and green, a silhouette of a person, and circular lines.

TRANSLATION STATE BY ANN LECKIE
Set in the same universe as Leckie’s Imperial Radch trilogy, Translation State follows Enae, who leaves hir long-standing isolation for what was supposed to be an interstellar goose chase. After hir demanding grandmaman dies, Enae is given a diplomat title and assigned to investigate a missing Presgr translator no one expects to be found (but that the government still wants the goodwill for pretending to look for). Only, Enae doesn’t just pretend to look; sie discovers sie has quite the knack for investigating the 200-year-old cold case.

This is how hir path crosses that of Reet, an adopted maintenance worker whose mysterious origins and unsettling impulses might be explained by being the child of the fugitive translator, if you ask Enae, or the last descendant of a lost sovereign line, if you ask one particularly zealous diaspora social group. Rounding out the POV characters is Qven, a young Presgr terrified of their species’ ritual of merging with an elder, a rite of passage which will see Qven’s selfhood entirely dissolved. Enae, Reet, and Qven’s explorations of their own identities wind up having interplanetary consequences, but it’s the way Leckie gives weight to the small moments, both personal and shared, that make this book sing.

Though I’m sure there are layers that only those familiar with the Imperial Radch trilogy will notice and appreciate, the standalone Translation State and its rich exploration of self-identification and personhood serve as a fantastic introduction to Leckie’s world. So don’t hesitate to jump into Translation State if you’re – like me – new to Radch and simply drawn to a thrilling mystery where the most intimate emotions can fuel a universal upheaval. —SG

Cover image for Rita Chang-Eppig’s Deep as the Sky, Red as the Sea, with facial features set against a crashing wave.

DEEP AS THE SKY, RED AS THE SEA BY RITA CHANG-EPPIG
I still remember standing in my local bookstore, struck by the cover of this book, and reading the summary. It had me at “Chinese pirate queen.”

In Deep as the Sky, Red as the Sea, Chang-Eppig writes a historical fantasy about Shek Yeung, a fearsome Chinese pirate who must navigate her fleet after the death of her powerful husband. She marries her late husband’s second-in-command, with the promise of bearing an heir, in order to retain power over the fleet — and stay a major player as the Chinese Emperor seeks to rid the waters of piracy.

The book isn’t paced like a thriller, so don’t make the mistake of assuming so when you start it. It’s equal parts historical exposition, strategy, and warfare — and it especially excels in its characterization of a complicated woman forced to make difficult decisions and sacrifices in order to protect her power. Fantasy can put its villains and heroes on pedestals, but Deep as the Sky, Red as the Sea never errs in its very human portrayal of Shek Yeung, and how deftly she must play this game of political chess for survival. I was riveted. —N. Clark

INK BLOOD SISTER SCRIBE BY EMMA TÖRZS
There’s nothing cozier than a magical book about the magic of books — though this tale bends a little darker, and tells a story about witchcraft and complicated family dynamics. In Ink Blood Sister Scribe, two estranged sisters come together to solve the mystery of their family, and prevent further tragedies. In this world, blood can be concocted into ink — wielded by scribes for the creation of books with arcane powers — though the creation of such books drains a scribe’s health. When others read these books, they create magic; willing flowers to bloom, or making magical carpets that can fly in the air.

Ink Blood Sister Scribe is the perfect sister thriller to read in one sitting. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it doesn’t need to — it simply delivers on a wonderfully entertaining premise. —N. Clark

WITCH KING BY MARTHA WELLS
In an era where a lot of fantasy fans value quick or cozy reads, Martha Wells’ Witch King feels like a gauntlet thrown at readers’ feet. It’s a complex, meaty fantasy that opens well into what a more linear book would consider the third act, as Kai, the witch king of the title, is exhumed from a watery grave and starts exploring who betrayed him and trapped him there. Readers have to learn everything about Kai’s world as his story unfolds in multiple intertwined timelines. That includes figuring out what a “witch king” is, unwrapping the layers of what Kai actually is and why it matters. It also means being introduced to a wide variety of allies and enemies while alternately flashing back to how he met them, and slowly coming to understand the dense political machinations that shaped all their lives in the past and present.

As with Wells’ Murderbot books and her Books of the Raksura series in particular, part of the draw here is a powerful, skilled protagonist whose biggest struggles are often internal. Kai has a lot of intense emotional responses to the world, but lacks the tools to understand what to do with those feelings, or who to trust with them. Wells packs Witch King with a lot of audacious, expansive world-building for a standalone novel (albeit one that could easily invite sequels or prequels), but what makes Witch King an enjoyable read instead of a frustrating one is the way all the book’s complications and surprises are filtered through Kai’s vivid inner life, giving readers something to hold onto as they’re untangling the puzzlebox aspects of this cleverly structured novel. —TR

THE LOST WAR (THE EIDYN SAGA #1) BY JUSTIN LEE ANDERSON
Originally self-published in 2019, The Lost War is a traditional fantasy adventure that follows a rag-tag group of strangers on a mission across a war-torn country, fighting monsters and uncovering mysteries along the way. Despite the strong buzz leading up to the novel’s expanded publication by Orbit this year, I found myself hesitant to pick it up since it seemed so similar to many books I’ve read before. But while it’s true The Lost War doesn’t rewrite the genre – it’s filled with well-worn tropes and classic adventurer archetypes – Anderson’s skillful execution left me completely charmed. There is a real Dungeons and Dragons feel to The Lost War, and though the characters are familiar (the honorable paladin, the hard-drinking haunted soldier), Anderson does a fantastic job developing unique dynamics between the party members that vault the book beyond the sum of its parts. And it all builds up to a massive twist at the end that completely upends your understanding of what you’ve read and any previous expectations for where the second book will go. The delightfully unexpected ending once again has the fantasy community buzzing ahead of Anderson’s next release – only this time I’m right there with them. —SG

TO SHAPE A DRAGON’S BREATH (NAMPESHIWEISIT #1) BY MONIQUILL BLACKGOOSE
To Shape a Dragon’s Breath’s description hooked me immediately: It’s got dragons, a magic school, and a strong teenage main character. Moniquill Blackgoose has taken several different fantasy tropes and created a fantasy novel that’s unlike anything I’ve read; To Shape a Dragon’s Breath is set in an evolving steampunk world as Anglish settlers push the Indigenous Masquapaug people out of their land and onto a remote island. Dragons had long been important cultural touchstones to the Indigenous people, but colonization has, too, pushed them away. To Shape a Dragon’s Breath begins as 15-year-old Anequs finds a dragon egg — the first to be spotted in the area in generations. Anequs is named a Nampeshiweisit, or a dragon rider, as the community helps raise and hatch the dragon’s egg.

The colonizing nation quickly finds out and forces Anequs and her dragon into the Anglish dragon school; if she resists, the dragon will be eliminated. To Shape a Dragon’s Breath is about the growing relationship between her and her dragon Kasaqua, but also about her resistance to the Anglish traditions relating to dragons. The Anglish treat dragons as something to be conquered — they use them as tools and weapons, whereas the Indigenous people have historically partnered with dragons for a relationship built on both tradition and respect.

That partnership means Anequs now has the power to take on colonialism and racism in a new way. Where To Shape a Dragon’s Breath really shines is in that growing relationship between Anequs and Kasaqua; the partnership — and power for both that comes with it — is in stark contrast to the Anglish ways. Bonus: To Shape a Dragon’s Breath has well-written, complex bisexual and neurodivergent characters, too. —Nicole Carpenter

LOKI BY MELVIN BURGESS
Melvin Burgess has spent a career writing confrontationally frank children’s literature like Junk, his 1990s book about heroin-addicted teenagers. His first adult book, published at age 69, is a blistering, transgressive, and hugely entertaining reframing of the Norse myths, as told by the most unreliable narrator imaginable: Loki himself, the god of tricks, inventions, and political intrigue. But what does reliable mean, anyway, in the mutable world of myth? Burgess paints Loki (or rather, has him paint himself, as he addresses the reader directly in first person) as an eternal outsider, shaking his head sagely at the follies of the gods, and challenging their might-is-right order. But of course, that’s what he’d want us to think. Burgess’ best trick, though, is the way he rolls together the deeply weird, muddy, shape-shifting mystery of the tales themselves with a bracing modernity in characterization and language, somehow without one clashing with the other. In doing so he brings the wild, ancient power of the Norse myths to vivid life. —Oli Welsh

CHAIN-GANG ALL-STARS BY NANA KWAME ADJEI-BRENYAH
In Chain-Gang All-Stars, prison inmates fight to the death in a series of gladiatorial matches — and all of it is televised to a hungry audience. It’s a program called CAPE, the Criminal Action Penal Entertainment, which promises freedom to inmates who survive three years of its brutality. The average life expectancy for anyone who enters is three months. Within this system, Loretta Thurwar and Hammara Stacker (called Hurricane Staxxx by her fans) emerge as two frontrunners.

This National Book Award finalist takes on the viciousness of the carceral system, with more than a bit of The Hunger Games’ DNA sprinkled in. “Hard action” fans salivate over matches, a self-obsessed announcer resents the fact that contestants don’t offer more banter, and the women who top the leaderboards become sex symbols in pop culture. But where other fight-to-the-death dystopias — among the greats, like Battle Royale or Lord of the Flies — spin a more fantastical yarn, Chain-Gang All-Stars is aimed right at the heart of the all-too-real cruelties of our existing for-profit penal system.

Early in the book, Thurwar kills a 16-year-old boy in a gladiator match. Fans in the stands lament not the death of the boy, but the idea that the fight wasn’t entertaining because it wasn’t a fair matchup. In a footnote, Adjei-Brenyah writes of George Stinney Jr., a 14-year-old Black boy who was convicted for murder and executed in 1944. Chain-Gang All-Stars also illustrates the ways in which imprisonment is simply “slavery by another name,” showing all manner of menial labor the contestants are forced to perform. In 2022, the ACLU reported that inmates made between 13 and 52 cents an hour, and sometimes nothing.

Critics have said this book is an “act of protest” but that it doesn’t “straightforwardly preach,” or that it’s more entertaining than “an attempt to convince its readers of the case for prison abolition has any right to be.” I understand why you’d want to say this book is “fun” despite an abolitionist message, especially in a political climate where radical writing is often appreciated only as a teaching tool. But I think that kind of delineation undercuts Adjei-Brenyah’s talent as a novelist, and his skill in heightening the real as a form of storytelling. I’d call it thrilling, over calling it fun. And the fact that it is thrilling is inextricable from its openly abolitionist values — it’s the very knowledge of real life that Adjei-Brenyah wields to craft suspense. —N. Clark

FOURTH WING BY REBECCA YARROS
This action-packed, fantasy romance feels like a grown up version of all of my favorite young adult books. It’s got all of the fun nostalgic tropes — a magical school, deadly trials, dragon riding, and a love triangle between the main character, a golden retriever love interest, and a misunderstood emo rival — but it’s also extremely horny, as all fun fantasy romance must be.

Violet Sorrengail is thrown into a series of trials in order to prove whether she can be a dragon rider. There are a few problems with this: she trained as a scribe, never thought she’d be thrust into danger, and she also must deal with Xaden Riorson, her sworn enemy (wink). She also manages a joint condition, which leaves her in chronic pain — a fact the book handles gracefully. In one of my favorite climactic moments of the book, Violet is given a mobility device to help her with her trials; those close to her remind her that it doesn’t diminish her power, but is a tool like any other, and one that allows her to flourish. I’m thrilled to read the next installment, when it comes out in November. —N. Clark

LORDS OF UNCREATION (THE FINAL ARCHITECTURE #3) BY ADRIAN TCHAIKOVSKY
Reading the Final Architecture series, I had to accept long ago that I would never fully grasp the nuances of some of its central concepts, even if I understood them on an instinctual level.

This acceptance set me up well for Lords of Uncreation, which revolves around concepts that even the characters find impossible to understand, and whose minds may literally break if they try to. Like looking directly into the sun, confronting the blurred space between the real and unreal (as well as the eldritch terrors that lurk within) poses a grave threat to those doing so head-on – at least to anyone other than weary intermediary Idris Tellemier, whose risk is merely reduced rather than eliminated. But the characters Adrian Tchaikovsky has populated this world with are so grounded, so emotionally rich, and so vibrant that the details of the brain-bending threats lurking within unspace become secondary to their impact on the lives of and relationships between the Vulture God’s crew.

This is not to say that Tchaikovsky does not deliver an incredibly satisfying conclusion to the mysteries of unspace (he does!). But what I’ll remember most is how he crafted the perfect emotional resolution to this intellectually intricate tale that left me in tears and has stayed with me since. —SG

THE FERRYMAN BY JUSTIN CRONIN
Proctor Bennett is a ferryman, whose duty is to guide unhappy citizens from the utopian Propersa to the Nursery, where they retire their old selves before returning in younger bodies with no memories of their former lives. But when Proctor is assigned to retire his own father, the troubling encounter sends him careening off the path of conformity. He begins questioning prescribed truths and confronting the darker side of Prospera, which runs off the work of a disenfranchised support staff whose discontent is building towards a revolution that pulls Proctor into its orbit.

Though this premise may feel familiar, The Ferryman is anything but. This tightly-wound, atmospheric thriller weaves together layers of knotted mystery with Proctor’s haunting POV as he grapples with his relationship to grief, happiness, family, and identity. It’s a sharply complex mystery with a cinematic quality to it. Throughout reading, I couldn’t help but fan-cast who would star in a Christopher Nolan adaptation of it. But even if you aren’t an Inception fan, it’ll be easy to become immersed in The Ferryman’s distinct dystopian world. —SG

SOME DESPERATE GLORY BY EMILY TESH
Around September, as the pile of unpainted plastic miniatures here in my home office began to get particularly deep, I suddenly ran out of Warhammer 40,000 Black Library audiobooks by Games Workshop that I was the least bit interested in listening to. That’s when I stumbled upon Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh. Billed as a space opera told from the perspective of one of humanity’s last genetically engineered super soldiers, I fell for the premise hook, line, and sinker. Then, about 50 pages in, I let it sucker-punch me right in the gut.

With Some Desperate Glory, Tesh has envisioned a deeply affecting reality where the children of a subjugated, war-torn race slowly come to realize that they have been lied to — manipulated into an amoral war of vengeance without end. Tesh shows incredible restraint throughout, reeling out a thick and binding thread of painful realizations from deep within the main character, Kyr. After grappling with my personal love for the grim darkness of the far future for quite a few years now, this book helped me come to terms with how much I despise those tropes even as I find myself drawn toward them time and time again.

Some Desperate Glory is, in my opinion, required reading for anyone who has ever painted a Space Marine in earnest – and a new fixture in the canon of queer science fiction. —Charlie Hall

CHLORINE BY JADE SONG
I think I have been waiting my whole life for this book — for someone to write adolescence like the body horror it is, with all of the cultural specificity of being a Chinese American girl, simply bursting at the seams with sapphic longing. Chlorine stars Ren Yu, a swimmer who believes that she is a mermaid. But she is tethered to land by her human ambition: By the parents who constantly push her to achieve, and by a swim coach who pays inappropriate attention to her — pushing her to swim faster times, while also making her feel uncomfortable in her skin.

Ren’s steadfast belief in being a mermaid feels both like a flight of fancy, and increasingly like a means of dissociating from the horrors of everyday life. Being a young girl is hard enough without having to contend with the high expectations of parents, the predation of adult men, and the casual racism of peers. Jade Song’s writing is gruesomely lyrical, contrasting the sublime with the deeply disturbing. There were several points where this book almost made me throw up, and I mean that as a high compliment. —N. Clark

A Black woman stands alone in a field, her face covered by shadow, in the cover art for Lone Women by Victor LaValle.
Image: One World
LONE WOMEN BY VICTOR LAVALLE
Adelaide Henry is traveling to Montana, where she plans on making a new life as a homesteader — leaving the flames of her California home, and the bodies of her parents, behind. But she has a heavy weight to carry. She lugs an enormous steam trunk wherever she goes; whenever the trunk opens, people around her die. In 1915, Montana is in the middle of a homestead boom, and though Adelaide aims to make a new start, not everyone is welcoming to a Black woman traveling alone.

Victor LaValle mixes horror and fantasy in this expertly paced tale. It’s satisfyingly bloody, while making incisive commentary on the price of being an outsider. The Western genre has long fixated on the white imagination, perhaps occasionally making space for the early struggle of the suffragettes. But LaValle’s vision of history emphasizes just how powerful white women are in upholding the interests of their white husbands, and how far these women will go to protect the societal structures that put them in proximity to power. Lone Women also examines how shame, and the family unit, ultimately uphold these unspoken rules — ostracizing those who might otherwise find community support.

This book was so good that I am now reading my way through every interview LaValle has given on the Lone Women press circuit, too, and then reading every book he references. What a gift! —N. Clark

THE STRANGE BY NATHAN BALLINGRUD
Nathan Ballingrud’s debut novel was added to my TBR pile after seeing it marketed as a blend of Ray Bradbury’s The Martian Chronicles and Charles Portis’ True Grit. I’m always dubious about marketing comparisons, but was thrilled when The Strange delivered on this high promise.

In an alternate history where humanity colonized Mars in the early 1900s, the red planet has lost all communication with Earth, leaving the fate of 14-year-old Annabelle Crisp’s mother unknown. When a thief steals Annabelle’s sole voice recording of her mom, she and her beloved Kitchen Engine, Watson, set off into the desert to retrieve what’s hers and see justice served. The longer Annabelle’s adventure goes on, the more she loses perspective and drifts away from righteousness in dogged pursuit of her own selfish desires. Struggling to comprehend that the world can’t be divided into binaries like right or wrong and black or white, Annabelle converts her fear into anger, lashing out and harming those around her, including those providing aid.

Annabelle can be vengeful and cruel, and though I often disagreed with her choices, Ballingrud makes it impossible not to understand and empathize with her. Annabelle Crisp isn’t a hero and she isn’t a villain, but she is an outstanding protagonist in a wonderfully original sci-fi tale. —SG

THE LIES OF THE AJUNGO (THE FOREVER DESERT #1) BY MOSES OSE UTOMI
In his debut novella, Moses Ose Utomi wields his precise prose to tell a dark, visceral fable about a young boy from the City of Lies, a metropolis reliant on the brutal Ajungo Empire for their supply of water. But the cost of this trade is high: At 13, every child of the City of Lies has their tongue cut out and sent to the Ajungo.

Even with this gruesome tithe, the Ajungo send barely enough water for the population to survive, and far from what they’d need to do so comfortably, let alone thrive. Shortly before his thirteenth birthday, the brave Tutu sets out on a dangerous journey to save his mother and the city by finding their own water supply. As Tutu explores the outside world for the first time, his perception of truth and history is challenged, and he comes to understand how the decisions and deceptions of those in power rewrite the past and shape the future to uphold those with privilege and foster compliance in those who don’t. —SG

ANTIMATTER BLUES BY EDWARD ASHTON
Edward Ashton’s sequel to Mickey 7, the 2022 novel Parasite director Bong Joon-ho is adapting as a movie starring Robert Pattinson, takes up two years after the first book left off, with “Expendable”-status planetary colonist Mickey still on the outs with the leadership of his struggling colony after a gutsy bluff he made to ensure his own survival. The sixth clone of the original Mickey, who accepted life as a disposable body for suicide missions in exchange for a ticket to space, Mickey 7 has walked off that job. His ongoing draw on the colony’s resources is only tolerated because he’s exaggerated his diplomatic connections with the local aliens. Then the base commander orders him to do something impossible, or the entire colony will die.

Antimatter Blues is knottier than the first book in the series, with more to take in about the ethics of survival and humanity’s predisposition toward xenophobia and selfish, self-serving behavior. It sure isn’t a pleasant book to read: A lot of Mickey’s co-colonists are bigots, most of them are indifferent to anyone else’s suffering, and at times, the book reads as though Earth deliberately sent all the worst people into space, the better to be free of them. Even Mickey himself is, at absolute minimum, generally more focused on his own safety and comfort than on the horrific results of some of his choices. But as soon as he’s placed in what seems like an unsurvivable situation, that dynamic leads to high drama, and Antimatter Blues becomes a breathless book rocketing to a surprising conclusion. Prepare to feel sorry for various alien races who have to deal with icky humanity. —TR

A DAY OF FALLEN NIGHT (THE ROOTS OF CHAOS #0) BY SAMANTHA SHANNON
Samantha Shannon’s A Day of Fallen Night is her second book in the Roots of Chaos series, but a prequel to The Priory of the Orange Tree. Like The Priory of the Orange Tree, A Day of Fallen Night is an epic, far-flung fantasy novel set in a world of magic and dragons. A Day of Fallen Night is set hundreds of years before The Priory of the Orange Tree, and follows several of the original book’s ancestors as the world fears the return of an evil wyrm, the Nameless One. You don’t have to have read The Priory of the Orange Tree to enjoy A Day of Fallen Night; in fact, it’s likely a good place to start if you’ve been interested in reading Shannon’s original, massive fantasy book. Of course, this is a slow-burn 800-page book that precedes another 800-page book, so it’s definitely a time investment regardless of the path.

Though A Day of Fallen Night deals with a world-shaping, cataclysmic threat and widespread political machinations, the book is rooted within four characters from around the book’s world: Sabran, Glorian, Dumai, and Tunuva Melim. The stories of these characters intertwine as their regional beliefs tied to wyrms and dragons conflict, muddying up the necessary collaboration in fighting off the looming threat. In between all that catastrophe, Shannon gives the women of the book rich stories of personal relationships, sacrifice, and conflicting feelings. Motherhood and bodily autonomy are also strong themes throughout the book; both Sabran and Glorian (mother and daughter) have their bodily autonomy tied to the fate of their region.

It’s not easy to describe A Day of Fallen Night in a short blurb — it does so many things and goes so many places. Shannon’s created a series that has the scale of The Lord of the Rings, wrapped up in a world of queer, female power. The Roots of Chaos, as a whole, is one of my favorite fantasy series ever. —N. Carpenter

OUR SHARE OF NIGHT BY MARIANA ENRÍQUEZ
This literary tome defies categorization, so I’ll paint a scene instead: A father (Juan) whisks his son (Gaspar) away on a trip. Juan is mercurial; at turns terrifying and violent, at turns bewilderingly tender, nearly infinite in love. But he is a closed book. And if you think you’ve seen his hands elongate, spindly fingers yielding to piercing claws — well no, you didn’t.

Slow, dreadful, and razor-sharp, Our Share of Night charts a family’s desperate attempt at escaping the clutches of a death cult in Argentina. Its members seek the secrets of immortality, and many are willing to pay any price to obtain it. Set in 1981, the novel’s supernatural terrors intertwine with those of the Dirty War, the authoritarian violence offering cover for the cult to operate uninhibited.

I will read anything Mariana Enríquez writes next, it’s an absolute joy to experience her work. —N. Clark

Cover image for Annalee Newitz’s The Terraformers, which features a futuristic cityscape with lush greenery.

THE TERRAFORMERS BY ANNALEE NEWITZ
The Terraformers concerns itself with one question: As a species evolves, what behaviors stick around? Set more than 50,000 years in the future (yes, you read that number right), The Terraformers details the process of terraforming and developing a privatized planet into a tourism joint for the super rich. Technology has advanced in barely fathomable ways, allowing, for instance, the extension of human-level intelligence to animals and robots. But some aspects of society might seem familiar: Real estate developers who jack up rent with no warning? Local governments that abhor public transit? That every video call still has one person who can’t get the camera to work?

Equal parts prescient and absurd, The Terraformers splits its story over three novellas, each 700 years apart. One of those stars a sentient train who teams up with an investigative journalist ... who also happens to be a cat ... who’s also trying to prove this ostensibly privatized planet is in fact public land. Written by a leading science journalist of our era (author Annalee Newitz is the founder of io9 and has written for basically every major science publication under our sun), The Terraformers is unexpectedly one of the most accurate representations of the journalistic process I’ve ever read. And it all culminates in an undeniable stance: That capitalistic power must still be held in check by the truth. Even 50,000 years in the future, a free press is among society’s most essential facets. The more things change... —Ari Notis

CHILDREN OF MEMORY (CHILDREN OF TIME #3) BY ADRIAN TCHAIKOVSKY
Adrian Tchaikovsky’s highly anticipated third book in the Children of Time trilogy once again delves into some of science fiction’s headiest topics. There are parallels to earlier installments — Tchaikovsky once again uses another hyper-intelligent animal species to examine the idea of what being “alive” really means. But he also takes readers somewhere completely and utterly new, outside the scope of the previous titles, and incredibly difficult to describe without spoiling the premise entirely.

All I can say is hold on for the ride. This is an author who dives head first into Asimov-esque ideas, and who is willing to take the plot in fanciful directions. I still can’t believe that I have recommended a book about sentient spider colonies to so many friends, but here we are. This finale is worth your time. —N.

5,"How to Maximize Your Impact as a Data Scientist

One of the hardest pills to swallow as an Individual Contributor (IC) at work is that nobody cares about the hard work you put in. They don’t even care about your output; they care about the impact you drive.

What’s the difference? Your output is the analysis you deliver, or the lines of code you write. Your impact is the decision your analysis helps the CEO make, or the revenue the new product feature is generating.


Image by author
If you want to establish yourself as a high performer and accelerate your career as a Data Scientist, it’s key to focus on impact.

In this post I’ll go over the following:
Why prioritizing impact matters not just for managers, but also ICs
Why focusing on impact is hard
How to maximize your impact
How to overcome common challenges in driving real impact
Let’s dive in.

Why should I focus on impact; isn’t that my manager’s job?
Of course you can leave it to your manager to worry about impact. But stepping up comes with some real benefits for your career:

Reduced frustration & burn-out: Putting a lot of work into a project and then feeling like it didn’t move the needle is one of the most frustrating feelings in any job.
Promotions: Promotions are heavily tied to impact. And if you want to become a manager, you’ll need to show that you understand what drives business outcomes and can allocate resources accordingly.
Internal opportunities: People around you notice if you are having an outsized impact, and you’ll increase your chances of receiving internal offers. My promotion to Director happened because the CMO noticed my work on the BizOps team and asked me to move into the Marketing org to build out a Strategy & Analytics team.
External opportunities: Prospective employers don’t focus on what responsibilities you had, but what your impact was. After all, they are trying to figure out how you can help their business.
Why isn’t everyone doing this?
Because it’s hard.

We are used to thinking about inputs and outputs rather than impact in our daily lives (“I went to the gym” or “I did three loads of laundry”) and we carry that mindset over to our jobs.

More importantly, it gives us a sense of control. It’s fully under your control to work hard on the project, and maybe to create the final deliverable, but you can’t guarantee that it will actually move the business forward.

It can also feel like we’re doing someone else’s job. You built the dashboard; now it’s the other team’s problem how they’re going use it and get value from it. You can definitely take this stance; but don’t you want to see your work move the needle?

Lastly, sometimes it’s unclear what impact even looks like for our role because we feel too disconnected from the business outcomes; I’ll get into this below.

How can I become more impact-focused?
Step 1: Understand what impact looks like for your role and measure your success accordingly
Stop thinking about productivity metrics like “I launched 5 experiments” or “I built this model” and hold yourself accountable to driving impact.

But what does that look like for a Data Scientist? For other roles it’s easy; Account Executives have sales quotas and Growth Marketing Managers have lead generation targets.

But Data Science, at its core, is a function that supports other teams. As a result, there are two levels of impact:


Image by author
Did your work change anything for the better for your business partners? E.g.:

Did your analysis change the roll-out strategy of the new product?
Did your model improve forecast accuracy?
Does your dashboard save the team hours every week that they used to spend on manual data pulls?
Did your work help move the needle on downstream business metrics? E.g.:

You’re a Marketing Data Scientist? Assume you’re on the hook for hitting lead and opportunity targets, and improving Marketing efficiency
You’re doing Analytics for the Customer Support org? Start obsessing about response times and satisfaction scores.
You don’t have to be solely responsible for something in order to take (partial) credit for it. If you provided the analysis that resulted in a pricing change that saved the company millions, then you deserve part of the credit for that impact.

You might not feel the consequences of missing these downstream targets as immediately as your stakeholders, but since your long-term career trajectory is still tied to driving impact, it helps to adopt this outcome-focused mindset.

Once you start doing this, you’ll notice more inefficiencies you can help address, or new opportunities for growth.

Step 2: Ensure your work solves a real business problem
You’ll likely know this situation: Instead of approaching you with a problem, people ask you for a specific deliverable. An analysis, a model, a dashboard.

If you blindly execute what they ask, you might realize too late that it won’t lead to tangible business impact. Maybe the problem they are trying to solve is not that important in the grand scheme of things, or there is a better way to approach it.

So what can you do?
Act like an owner. Understand the actual problem behind the request, and ask yourself what business priority this supports.

If you are early in your career then your manager should ideally help with this. But don’t rely on this: Managers don’t always do a perfect job, and you’ll be the one to feel the consequences of badly scoped work.

This requires you to understand company level priorities and the priorities of other orgs and teams. Take notes during All Hands meetings etc. to understand the big picture, and get your hands on other team’s planning materials to get an idea of what they’re trying to accomplish in the next 1–2 quarters.

Step 3: Ensure there is buy-in for your work
Even if your work directly supports company-level priorities, you’ll be in for a bad time if key stakeholders are not bought in.

You don’t want to be in a situation where you finish the work and then realize that another team is blocking the implementation because they have concerns you didn’t address. To avoid this, you’ll:

Need to understand whose support you need, and
Get them onboard from the get-go
This is a complex topic in itself; I’ll write a separate deep dive on how to drive alignment and get buy-in from other teams in the near future.

Step 4: Focus your time on the highest-impact thing
No matter what role you’re in, you’re likely juggling multiple priorities. To maximize your impact, you need to ensure you spend the majority of your time on the most important thing.

As with many things, this is easier said than done though, so let’s talk about what that looks like concretely.

Ad-hoc requests vs. strategic work
It’s easy to get caught up in the craziness of daily business only to realize you didn’t make any progress on the big, strategic project you actually care about.

This is all too common; none of us get to sit in our ivory tower and chip away at our projects undisturbed. Plus, ad-hoc work is impactful, too; while it’s less exciting than strategic projects, it’s what keeps the business running.

Still, if you find yourself spending the majority of your time fielding these ad-hoc issues, it’s time to talk to your manager. I’m sure your manager would rather help protect your bandwidth than have you 1) miss your deadlines on your key projects and 2) quit eventually from frustration.


Image by author
Don’t cry over spilled milk
Another common challenge comes from the sunk cost fallacy. You invested a lot of time into a project, but it doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. Maybe you realized the premise didn’t make as much sense as you thought, or the priorities of the business have changed since you started the work.

Instead of talking to your manager and stakeholders about changing the scope of the project or abandoning it altogether, you’re doubling down to get it over the finish line. After all, you don’t want all of your effort to go to waste. Sound familiar?

Economists (and Poker players) figured out a long time ago that this is a dangerous trap. When prioritizing your time, ignore how much effort your already put in and focus on where the next hour of work will yield the most impact.

Things to watch out for (“impact killers”)
How do you minimize the odds of wasting time on a project that won’t lead to impact? There are a few warning signs:

“Academic” projects: Any time a project is pitched to you along the lines of “This would be interesting to understand” you should be careful; projects that purely improve the understanding of an issue without tying it back to the business are a waste of time and source of frustration in my experience
Overly ambitious project scope: At Uber, everyone always wanted to understand what the “best” driver incentive type is. Many people worked on this over the years, but it never led anywhere. There was no simple “one-size-fits-all” answer to this question, and the projects that led to actual impact were much more concrete, tactical optimizations
The customer or deliverable are not defined: If it’s not clear who the end user of your work is (are you doing this for your manager, leadership, or another team?), or you’re unsure what exactly you’re supposed to deliver, it should raise a red flag. This is typically a sign that the project needs more scoping work before someone should start running with it
Common Challenges and How to Address Them
We talked about general frameworks to maximize impact. But how do you make actual, specific projects more impactful?

Many times, projects fail close to the finish line. Impact doesn’t materialize automatically, so you need to put in the final bit of work to ensure your work gets adopted. Doing this has an extremely high return on the time you invest since you already did the hard work to produce the deliverable and “only” need to close the loop with stakeholders.


Image by author
To make things more tangible, I am going to go through a few types of common deliverables, touch on where they typically fail to create impact and propose what you can do about it:

1. You create a comprehensive analysis but nobody is acting on it
Problem: This is common with analyses that don’t have a clear recommendation. If you simply outline the data and potential paths forward, you are expecting your audience to do all of the heavy lifting.

Solution: Your work starts adding real value for them once you take that work off their plate. Always give a clear recommendation; you can caveat it and show alternatives in the appendix, but you need to take a stance.

2. You ran an experiment but nobody is using the results
Problem: Many experiments conclude with a metrics read-out by Data Science. More often than not, this is a “metrics dump” with a lot of information, but little interpretation or context.

Solution: Help your business partners interpret the results, and tell them how it affects what they care about.

How should they think about the statistical significance or lack thereof?
Is the observed lift good compared to other changes you tested and shipped?
What is your recommendation for next steps? What does the experiment result mean for this person or team specifically?
Remember, you are the subject matter expert and shouldn’t expect non-analytical audiences to interpret raw experiment data. Telling your stakeholders what the result means for them will increase chances they will act on it.

3. You built a predictive model, but the team you built it for is not using it
Problem: When predictive models don’t get used, it’s often because of a lack of trust in the model output.

ML models themselves tend to be black boxes, and if teams don’t understand how the outputs were generated and whether they are reliable, they are hesitant to rely on them. Even if your model is not using ML and lives in a spreadsheet: If people don’t know how it works, they’ll be suspicious.

Solution: It’s all about involving stakeholders in the process and building trust.

Involve stakeholders in the model development from the get-go to get them comfortable and address any concerns early on
Demystify the output; for example, you can extract the top model features and explain them
Sanity-check predictions and compare them to intuition. For example, if you forecast sales but your model predicts a different seasonality pattern from previous years, you’ll need to be able to explain why, or you’ll lose trust. In my experience, this is more impactful than just sharing performance metrics like the accuracy of the model
Having a structured playbook for how to do this will make your life easier, so I’ll cover this in a separate post in the near future.

4. You created a dashboard but nobody is looking at it
Problem: If a dashboard doesn’t get used, it’s likely one of these things is true:

The dashboard doesn’t directly address an urgent business use case
You didn’t involve your stakeholders along the way (e.g. by sharing mock-ups and drafts for feedback) and the final product is not what they were hoping for
The dashboard is complex and your users don’t understand how to get what they need
Solution: To address #1 and #2, start with user research to understand pain points and potential use cases of the dashboard, and involve your stakeholders during development.

With regards to #3, a simpler dashboard that users are comfortable with beats a more advanced one that doesn’t get used. If you cannot (or don’t want to) simplify the dash further, you’ll need to train your users on the functionality and shadow them to understand any points of friction.

A dashboard is not done when you ship it for the first time, but needs to be improved over time based on users’ needs and feedback.

Closing Thoughts
Focusing on impact is scary since we leave the world of controllable inputs behind, but it’s what ultimately gets you promotions and new job opportunities.

And isn’t it nice when your work actually feels like it moves the needle?

Abstract
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
merges retrieval methods with deep learning
advancements to address the static limitations
of large language models (LLMs) by enabling
the dynamic integration of up-to-date external
information. This methodology, focusing
primarily on the text domain, provides a
cost-effective solution to the generation of
plausible but incorrect responses by LLMs,
thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability
of their outputs through the use of real-world
data. As RAG grows in complexity and
incorporates multiple concepts that can
influence its performance, this paper organizes
the RAG paradigm into four categories:
pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and
generation, offering a detailed perspective
from the retrieval viewpoint. It outlines
RAG’s evolution and discusses the field’s
progression through the analysis of significant
studies. Additionally, the paper introduces
evaluation methods for RAG, addressing
the challenges faced and proposing future
research directions. By offering an organized
framework and categorization, the study
aims to consolidate existing research on
RAG, clarify its technological underpinnings,
and highlight its potential to broaden the
adaptability and applications of LLMs.
1 Introduction
The advent of ChatGPT has significantly impacted
both academia and industry due to its interactive
capabilities and widespread application, establishing itself as a leading artificial intelligence tool
(Laskar et al., 2023; Jahan et al., 2023; Huang
and Huang, 2024). At the core of ChatGPT is the
large language model (LLM) GPT-4, as detailed by
(OpenAI et al., 2023), which has seen numerous
enhancements to its predecessors, showcasing exceptional abilities in a variety of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks (Laskar et al., 2020). Despite these advancements, the adoption of LLMs
Figure 1: An example of RAG benefits ChatGPT resolves questions that cannot be answered beyond the
scope of the training data and generates correct results.
has highlighted several critical issues primarily due
to their reliance on extensive datasets. This reliance
restricts their ability to incorporate new information post-training, leading to three primary challenges. First, the focus on broad and general data
to maximize accessibility and applicability results
in subpar performance in specialized areas. Second,
the rapid creation of online data, combined with the
significant resources required for data annotation
and model training, hinders LLMs’ ability to stay
updated. Third, LLMs are susceptible to generating convincing yet inaccurate responses, known as
“hallucinations”, which can mislead users.
Addressing these challenges is crucial for LLMs
to be effectively utilized across various domains. A
promising solution is the integration of RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG) technology, which
supplements models by fetching external data in
response to queries, thus ensuring more accurate
and current outputs. Figure 1 illustrates how RAG
can enable ChatGPT to provide precise answers
beyond its initial training data.
Since its introduction by Lewis et al. (Lewis
et al., 2020b) in 2020, RAG technology has undergone significant advancements, particularly influenced by ChatGPT’s success. However, there is a
noticeable gap in the literature regarding a thorough
analysis of RAG’s mechanisms and the progress
made by subsequent studies. Furthermore, the field
is characterized by diverse research focuses and the
use of ambiguous terminology for similar methods,
leading to confusion. This paper aims to clarify these aspects by offering a structured overview of
RAG, categorizing various methods, and delivering an in-depth understanding of this research area.
This survey will primarily focus on textual applications of RAG, reflecting the current emphasis of
research efforts in this area.
RAG combines retrieval methods and advanced
deep learning to address two main questions: effectively retrieving relevant information and generating accurate responses. The workflow of RAG
is outlined in Section 2, categorizing the methodologies into pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval,
and generation phases. These sections, from 3 to
6, provide an in-depth analysis of the technologies
within these phases. Section 7 offers summaries of
the reviewed studies, along with the retrievers and
generators utilized. Section 8 details the evaluation
methodologies for RAG. Section 9 explores future
research directions, concentrating on text-based
studies and extending to image and multimodal
data considerations. The conclusion is presented in
Section 10.
The contributions of this paper are threefold:
This paper offers a comprehensive framework for
understanding the RAG domain, identifying areas
for improvement and challenges for future research.
It provides a detailed analysis of RAG’s core technologies, examining their strengths in addressing
retrieval and generation. Additionally, it introduces
the evaluation methods used in RAG research, highlighting current challenges and suggesting promising directions for future studies.
2 RAG Framework
The hallucinations are largely attributed to LLMs’
inability to access up-to-date information. This
limitation stems from the models’ reliance on their
training datasets. RAG proposes a solution to this
issue by supplementing the LLM’s training data
with current information from external sources
through a retrieval model, thereby enabling the generation of accurate responses. RAG presents a more
cost-effective alternative to the extensive training
and fine-tuning processes typically required for
LLMs. It allows for the dynamic incorporation
of fresh information via traditional retrieval methods or pre-trained LMs, without the need to directly
integrate this new data into the LLM. This feature
makes RAG both flexible and scalable, facilitating its application across different LLMs for various purposes. The information retrieved through
RAG is derived from real-world data, authored
by humans, which not only simplifies the generation process but also increases the reliability of
the generated responses. Figure 2 represents the
unified RAG framework with basic workflow and
paradigm.
Research by Khandelwal et al. (Khandelwal
et al., 2020) demonstrates that accessing relevant
information from the training dataset itself can significantly improve LLM performance, highlighting the effectiveness of RAG. Over time, RAG
has evolved from a means of providing supplementary information to enabling multiple interactions
between the retrieval and generation components.
This involves conducting several rounds of retrieval
to refine the accuracy of the information retrieved
and iteratively improve the quality of the generated output. Platforms such as LangChain1
and
LlamaIndex2 have modularized the RAG approach,
enhancing its adaptability and expanding its range
of applications. Despite these platforms employing
diverse methodologies to tackle different aspects of
RAG—from multiple search iterations to iterative
generation—they maintain adherence to the fundamental RAG workflow. This consistency is crucial
for understanding their operation and pinpointing
opportunities for further development.
2.1 Basic RAG Workflow
The foundational workflow of RAG begins with the
creation of an index comprising external sources.
This index serves as the basis for retrieving relevant
information through a retriever model based on a
specific query. The final step involves a generator
model, which combines the retrieved information
with the query to produce the desired output.
2.1.1 Indexing
Efficient retrieval begins with comprehensive indexing, where data preparation is key. This stage
involves text normalization processes such as tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words
to enhance the text’s suitability for indexing (Manning et al., 2008). Text segments are then organized
into sentences or paragraphs to facilitate more focused searches, allowing for the pinpointing of segments containing pertinent keywords. The integration of deep learning has revolutionized indexing
through the use of pretrained LMs for generating
semantic vector representations of texts. These vectors are stored, enabling rapid and precise retrieval from extensive data collections, significantly
enhancing retrieval efficiency.
2.1.2 Retrieval
While traditional retrieval methods, such as the
BM25 algorithm (Hancock-Beaulieu et al., 1996),
focus on term frequency and presence for document
ranking, they often overlook the semantic information of queries. Current strategies leverage pretrained LMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), which
capture the semantic essence of queries more effectively. These models improve search accuracy by
considering synonyms and the structure of phrases,
thereby refining document ranking through the detection of semantic similarities. This is typically
achieved by measuring vector distances between
documents and queries, combining traditional retrieval metrics with semantic understanding to yield
search results that are both relevant and aligned
with user intent.
2.1.3 Generation
The generation phase is tasked with producing text
that is both relevant to the query and reflective of
the information found in the retrieved documents.
The usual method involves concatenating the query
with the retrieved information, which is then fed
into an LLM for text generation (Li et al., 2022).
Although ensuring the generated text’s alignment
and accuracy with the retrieved content presents
challenges, it is also essential to strike a balance between adhering closely to the source material and
infusing the output with creativity. The generated
text should accurately convey the information from
the retrieved documents and align with the query’s
intent, while also offering the flexibility to introduce new insights or perspectives not explicitly
contained within the retrieved data.
2.2 RAG Paradigm
The RAG paradigm organizes research within
the domain, offering a straightforward yet robust
framework to enhance LLM performance. Central to RAG is its search mechanism, crucial for
generating high-quality outcomes. Therefore, this
paradigm is structured into four main phases from
a retrieval perspective: pre-retrieval, retrieval, postretrieval, and generation. Both single-hop and
multi-hop retrieval approaches, encompassing iterative retrieve-generate cycles, follow this four-phase
structure. Figure 3 is the taxonomy tree of RAG’s
core techniques.
2.2.1 Pre-Retrieval
The pre-retrieval phase of retrieval-augmented generation lays the foundation for successful data and
query preparation, ensuring efficient information
retrieval. This phase includes essential tasks to
prepare for effective data access.
Indexing The process starts with indexing, which
establishes an organized system to enable fast and
accurate retrieval of information. The specificity
of indexing depends on the task and data type.
For example, sentence-level indexing is beneficial
for question-answering systems to precisely locate
answers, while document-level indexing is more
appropriate for summarizing documents to understand their main concepts and ideas.
Query Manipulation After indexing, query manipulation is performed to adjust user queries for
a better match with the indexed data. This involves query reformulation (Jansen et al., 2009;
Yu et al., 2020), which rewrites the query to align
more closely with the user’s intention; query expansion (Huang et al., 2013), which extends the query
to capture more relevant results through synonyms
or related terms; and query normalization, which
resolves differences in spelling or terminology for
consistent query matching.
Data Modification Data modification is also critical in enhancing retrieval efficiency. This step
includes preprocessing techniques like removing
irrelevant or redundant information to improve the
quality of results and enriching the data with additional information such as metadata to boost the
relevance and diversity of the retrieved content
(Bevilacqua et al., 2022a).
2.2.2 Retrieval
Search & Ranking The retrieval stage is the
combination of search and ranking. It focuses on
selecting and prioritizing documents from a dataset
to enhance the quality of the generation model’s
outputs. This stage employs search algorithms to
navigate through the indexed data, finding documents that match a user’s query. After identifying
relevant documents, the process of initially ranking
these documents starts to sort them according to
their relevance to the query.
2.2.3 Post-Retrieval
The post-retrieval phase serves to refine the initially
retrieved documents to improve the quality of text
generation. This phase consists of re-ranking and
filtering, each aimed at optimizing the document
selection for the final generation task.
Re-Ranking In the re-ranking step, the documents previously retrieved are reassessed, scored,
and reorganized. The objective is to more accurately highlight the documents most relevant to
the query and diminish the importance of the less
relevant ones. This step involves incorporating additional metrics and external knowledge sources
to enhance precision. In this context, pre-trained
models with superior accuracy but lower efficiency
can be effectively employed due to the limited set
of candidate documents available (Huang and Hu,
2009).
Filtering Filtering aims to remove documents
that fail to meet specified quality or relevance
standards. This can be done through several approaches, such as establishing a minimum relevance score threshold to exclude documents below
a certain relevance level. Furthermore, the use of
feedback from users or prior relevance evaluations
assists in adjusting the filtering process, guaranteeing that only the most relevant documents are
retained for text generation (Khattab and Zaharia,
2020; Huang and Huang, 2023).
2.2.4 Generation
The generation stage is a crucial component of the
RAG process, responsible for leveraging retrieved
information to enhance the quality of the generated
response. This stage encompasses several sub-steps
aimed at producing content that is readable, engaging, and informative.
Enhancing At the heart of the generation phase
is the enhancement step, where the objective is
to merge the retrieved information with the user’s
query to create a coherent and relevant response.
This includes the process of elaboration, adding
extra details to the retrieved content to enrich it. Efforts are focused on improving the output’s quality
by increasing its clarity, coherence, and stylistic
appeal through methods such as rephrasing and
restructuring. Information from various sources
is combined to offer a comprehensive perspective,
and verification is conducted to ensure the accuracy
and relevance of the content.
Customization Customization is an optional
step, involving the adjustment of content to align
with the user’s specific preferences or the context
of the request. This tailoring includes adapting the
content to meet the needs of the target audience or
the format in which it will be presented and condensing the information to succinctly convey the
essence of the content. The process also entails
creating summaries or abstracts that emphasize the
key points or arguments, ensuring the output is both
informative and concise.
3 Pre-Retrieval
3.1 Indexing
The integration of the k-nearest neighbor (kNN)
algorithm with pre-trained neural LMs, as demonstrated in kNN-LMs (Khandelwal et al., 2020), represents significant progress in language modeling. This method employs a datastore created from collections of texts, enabling the dynamic retrieval of
contextually relevant examples to improve perplexity without necessitating additional training.
Known for its efficiency, FAISS (Johnson et al.,
2021) has been adopted in many studies for indexing purposes (Khandelwal et al., 2020; Lewis et al.,
2020b; Khattab et al., 2022). Some research integrates enhancements like the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) approximation (Malkov
and Yashunin, 2020) to achieve faster retrieval
(Lewis et al., 2020b). In addition, alternative tools
like utilizing the Bing API 3
for indexing based
on actual user search histories as outlined in Webgpt (Nakano et al., 2021), illustrate the variety of
indexing techniques under investigation.
Furthermore, MEMWALKER (Chen et al.,
2023a) introduces an innovative method to overcome the limitations of context window size in
LLMs by creating a memory tree from the input
text. This tree is formed by initially segmenting
the text into smaller pieces and then summarizing these segments into a hierarchical structure of
summary nodes, facilitating efficient indexing and
management of large volumes of information.
3.2 Query Manipulation
Studies such as FiD (Izacard and Grave, 2021),
COK(Li et al., 2023), and Query2doc (Wang et al.,
2023a) emphasize the significance of creating new
queries or refining existing ones to achieve more
3
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-websearch-api
pertinent retrieval results. These research efforts
highlight the necessity of efficiently gathering evidence from multiple passages and tailoring queries
to suit various knowledge sources, whether structured or unstructured. Techniques ranging from the
creation of pseudo-documents to enhance queries
have shown to bolster retrieval performance across
diverse information retrieval datasets.
Further exploration into query manipulation has
been conducted by Step-Back (Zheng et al., 2023)
and PROMPTAGATOR (Dai et al., 2023), which
focus on abstracting high-level concepts or utilizing LLMs for prompt-based query generation.
These strategies strive to better align queries with
the retrieval system’s functionality by rephrasing
tasks into more generalized versions or crafting
task-specific queries from limited examples. Such
methodologies enhance the consistency between
queries and indexed data, facilitating the retrieval
of more pertinent and insightful information.
Moreover, KnowledGPT (Wang et al., 2023b)
and Rewrite-Retrieve-Read (Ma et al., 2023) introduce approaches for query manipulation through
“program of thought” prompting and innovative
query rewriting techniques. KnowledGPT innovates by generating code to interface with knowledge bases, converting user queries into structured
search commands. In contrast, Rewrite-RetrieveRead utilizes a trainable compact LM for query
reformulation, adjusting them to more effectively
reflect the user’s intent and context.
Lastly, FLARE (Jiang et al., 2023) presents a
strategy based on confidence for query formulation, which focuses on crafting queries that precisely
reflect the information needs. This method incorporates the use of generated sentences or fragments
thereof as a foundation for search queries. By opting to directly use sentences, obscuring tokens of
low confidence, or formulating explicit questions,
this approach aims to boost the efficiency of the
retrieval process, ensuring that the retrieved information faithfully satisfies the requirements of the
generation process.
3.3 Data Modification
RA-DIT (Lin et al., 2023b) and RECITE (Sun et al.,
2023) emphasize enhancements through internal
data modifications. RA-DIT distinguishes between
fine-tuning datasets for LLMs and retrievers, aiming to bolster the LLM’s contextual comprehension
and the retriever’s ability to align with queries. RECITE, on the other hand, utilizes passage hints and
synthetic question-passage pairs to increase the
variety and relevance of its generated recitations
and responses. This approach seeks to broaden the
model’s knowledge base and improve its response
accuracy.
UPRISE (Cheng et al., 2023a) and GENREAD
(Yu et al., 2023a) target the refinement of external
data. UPRISE converts raw task data into a structured format and refines the selection of prompts
to enhance retrieval outcomes. In contrast, the
Clustering-Based Prompts method employed by
GENREAD generates documents from questions
and clusters them to eliminate irrelevant data, enriching the input with varied contextual insights.
This technique aims to improve the performance of
the generative model by providing it with a richer
set of information.
Furthermore, KnowledGPT (Wang et al., 2023b)
is dedicated to augmenting raw text data with structured, semantically rich information through entity
linking. This enrichment process not only structures the data more cohesively and makes it more
amenable to queries but also boosts the model’s
retrieval efficiency. It leverages precise, linked
knowledge to enhance the model’s understanding and its ability to generate relevant responses,
thereby improving its overall performance.
4 Retrieval
4.1 Search & Ranking
Atlas (Izacard et al., 2023) investigates few-shot
learning approaches, including Attention Distillation and Perplexity Distillation, to steer the retriever toward retrieving more relevant documents.
IRCOT (Trivedi et al., 2023) integrates retrieval
with reasoning to improve the effectiveness of retrieval. SURGE (Kang et al., 2023) employs a
subgraph retriever to extract relevant subgraphs
from a knowledge graph, while AAR (Yu et al.,
2023b) modifies search preferences to help LLMs
in fetching pertinent documents.
PRCA (Yang et al., 2023a) focuses on employing domain-specific abstractive summarization to
extract relevant and context-rich information from
documents, using a supervised learning strategy
to prioritize content crucial for accurate query responses. Meanwhile, MEMWALKER (Chen et al.,
2023a) leverages an internal search and ranking
mechanism in the constructed memory tree to identify pertinent information for long-context question
answering. Additionally, the Confidence-based Active Retrieval approach of FLARE (Jiang et al.,
2023) dynamically triggers information retrieval
based on the confidence levels of generated sentences, utilizing the insight that low-confidence
tokens signal a need for external knowledge.
5 Post-Retrieval
5.1 Re-Ranking
Re2G (Glass et al., 2022) introduces a sequencepair classification approach for re-ranking, utilizing a BERT transformer to simultaneously analyze
the query and passage. This interaction model, employing cross-attention between sequences, offers a
contrast to the representation model typically used
in initial retrieval phases. PROMPTAGATOR (Dai
et al., 2023) also employs a cross-attention model
for re-scoring. Its “Lift Yourself Up” strategy iteratively selects the best candidate from a pool for
further generation rounds, progressively improving
content quality via self-generated content.
Re-ranking is also a significant focus of InContext RALM (Ram et al., 2023). Two approaches to reranking are explored: zero-shot
reranking using language models and predictive
reranking through trained models. This step is
aimed at refining the selection of documents based
on their expected utility for improving language
model performance. ITER-RETGEN (Shao et al.,
2023), in particular, leverages knowledge distillation from the re-ranker to the dense retriever, finetuning retrieval efforts based on relevance signals
from LLM outputs. This optimization of the retrieval model aims to more accurately capture query
nuances, thereby improving document selection.
DKS-RAC (Huang et al., 2023) presents the
Dense Knowledge Similarity (DKS) for aligning
the knowledge between answers and retrieved passages at the sequence level. This approach is categorized under re-ranking due to its direct impact on
passage selection based on knowledge similarity,
refining the match between queries and documents.
FiD-light (Hofstätter et al., 2023) introduces a
listwise autoregressive re-ranking method that employs source pointers to optimize the ranking order.
This method maintains a link between the generated text and source passages, enabling a more
structured generation process. By incorporating
textual citations within the model’s output as pointers to relevant information sources, this approach
facilitates an organized retrieval and generation
process, enhancing the overall coherence and relevance of the generated content.
5.2 Filtering
COK (Li et al., 2023) presents the Progressive Rationale Correction technique, aimed at iteratively
refining rationales with retrieved knowledge. This
method constitutes a continuous optimization process, significantly enhancing the relevance and
quality of information used in content generation.
Self-RAG (Asai et al., 2023) introduces a selfreflection mechanism to efficiently filter out irrelevant content. By employing critique tokens, this
approach evaluates the relevance, supportiveness,
and utility of retrieved passages, ensuring the integration of only high-quality information into the
content generation process.
Additionally, FiD-TF (Berchansky et al., 2023)
and RECOMP (Xu et al., 2023) are dedicated to the
removal of irrelevant or redundant tokens and information from retrieved documents. FiD-TF employs
a dynamic mechanism to identify and eliminate unnecessary tokens, enhancing the efficiency of information processing. RECOMP, on the other hand,
compresses documents into concise summaries, focusing on selecting only the most pertinent content
for the generation process. These methods streamline the content generation workflow by ensuring
that only relevant and supportive information is
utilized, thereby improving the overall quality and
relevance of the generated content.
6 Generation
6.1 Enhancing
DSP (Khattab et al., 2022) introduces a framework
designed to generate multiple retrieval queries to
summarize and answer questions, drawing upon information aggregated from various passages. This
framework employs CombSUM (Fox and Shaw,
1994) to calculate a cumulative probability score
for passages across different retrieval lists, facilitating the compilation of a comprehensive response
from multiple sources.
PRCA (Yang et al., 2023a) outlines a RewardDriven Stage, wherein the distilled context is refined based on feedback from the generator. Utilizing reinforcement learning, this stage adjusts
the parameters of PRCA according to the rewards
received for providing relevant context. The objective is to fine-tune the extracted context to meet
the specific requirements of the generator, thereby
optimizing the generation process.
REPLUG (Shi et al., 2023) proposes a method
for prepending retrieved documents to the input
context before the final prediction by the black-box
LM. It introduces an ensemble strategy to encode
retrieved documents in parallel, overcoming the
limitations of LM context length and enhancing
accuracy through the allocation of increased computational resources. This approach improves the
generation process by ensuring that the LM has
access to a broader range of relevant information.
RECITE (Sun et al., 2023) implements a selfconsistency technique, which involves generating
multiple recitations independently and employing
a plurality/majority vote system to determine the
most appropriate answer. This method is designed
to increase the reliability and accuracy of the answers, thereby improving the quality and credibility
of the output.
6.2 Customization
The PKG framework, introduced by (Luo et al.,
2023), represents an approach to customizing the
output of LMs. By generating background knowledge internally using a pre-trained model, PKG
eliminates the need for traditional external retrieval
processes. This method directly integrates domainor task-specific knowledge into the generation step,
significantly enhancing the LM’s capacity to produce responses that are specifically tailored to the
given context or requirements.
Self-RAG (Asai et al., 2023) offers a strategy that incorporates reflection tokens within a customizable decoding algorithm. This technique permits dynamic adjustment of the model’s retrieval
and generation behaviors based on the specific task,
facilitating more versatile response generation. Depending on the requirements, this approach can be
tuned for accuracy or creativity, providing flexibility in generating outputs that meet diverse needs.
SURGE (Kang et al., 2023) achieves customization through the application of graph-text contrastive learning. This method ensures that the
generated dialogue responses are in tight alignment
with the knowledge contained in the retrieved subgraph, yielding responses that are specific, relevant,
and deeply rooted in the dialogue context. By maintaining consistency between the retrieved knowledge and the generated text, SURGE is capable
of producing outputs that precisely reflect the detailed knowledge of the subgraph, enhancing the
relevance and specificity of the responses.
7 Comparisons of RAG
7.1 The Comprehensive Summary of RAG
Table 1 presents a detailed analysis of the RAG
studies discussed in this paper. The analysis shows
that the majority of these studies have utilized external data sources to enrich the content of LLMs.
A preference for multiple-hop over single-hop retrieval was noted, indicating that iterative search
rounds generally yield superior results. In other
words, most methods employ dense retrieval to secure higher quality candidate documents. Compared to modifying datasets in the pre-retrieval
stage, more studies focus on manipulating the query
to improve retrieval performance. Additionally,
there is a significant emphasis on optimizing the
retrieval phase, highlighting its crucial role in the
research. However, there seems to be a scarcity
of studies concentrating on customization in the
generation stage, pointing to this as a potential area
for future exploration. Overall, while the goal of
RAG is to enhance the response quality of LLMs,
greater efforts have been directed towards improving retrieval aspects.
7.2 Retriever and Generator
In RAG, the retriever and the generator are the
primary components. Table 2 summarizes the retrievers and generators used in the studies discussed
in this paper. It is clear from the table that while
most generators utilize advanced language models,
a significant number of retrievers still employ the
traditional BM25 due to its efficiency. The method
of retrieval is a crucial aspect in RAG, highlighting the importance of exploring ways to enhance
retrieval performance without compromising efficiency. Similarly, not many studies have adopted
powerful LLMs such as LLaMA2, GPT-3.5, or
GPT-4 as their generators. LLMs like T5 remain
popular, yet fundamental models like BERT and
Transformers are rarely used in 2023. Compared
to generators, it is evident that not many IR-based
LLMs are used in retrievers, indicating a promising
direction for developing such models in the future.
8 Evaluation in RAG
To understand the effectiveness of LMs in generating more accurate, relevant, and robust responses
by leveraging external knowledge, the evaluation
of RAG systems has become a significant research
area. With the popularity of dialogue-based interactions, recent works have been focused on assessing
the performance of RAG models on such downstream tasks using established metrics like Exact
Match (EM) and F1 scores. Furthermore, a wide
array of datasets has been utilized for this purpose,
including TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), HotpotQA
(Yang et al., 2018), FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018),
Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), Wizard of Wikipedia (Dinan et al., 2019), and T-REX
(ElSahar et al., 2018).
However, evaluation solely from the perspective of downstream tasks falls short in addressing
the evolving needs of RAG development. Recent
research has introduced various frameworks and
benchmarks that aim to evaluate these systems
across multiple dimensions, including the quality
of the generated text, the relevance of retrieved
documents, and the model’s resilience to misinformation, as shown in Table 3. These evaluations focus on assessing specific capabilities such as noise
robustness, negative prompting, information integration, and counterfactual robustness, highlighting the complex challenges faced by RAG systems
in practical applications. The continuous development of evaluation frameworks and metrics is
crucial for advancing the field, broadening the applicability of RAG systems, and ensuring they meet
the demands of a complex and evolving information landscape.
8.1 Retrieval-based Aspect
In information retrieval, the quality of search results is typically evaluated using standard metrics
such as Mean Average Precision (MAP), Precision,
Reciprocal Rank, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) (Radlinski and Craswell,
2010; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019; Nogueira et al.,
2019). These metrics primarily assess the relevance
of retrieved documents to a given query.
Retrieval-based Metrics in RAG focus on the effectiveness of retrieving relevant information to
support generation tasks. These include Accuracy, which measures the precision of retrieved
documents in providing correct information for answering queries, and Rejection Rate (Chen et al.,
2023b), assessing a system’s ability to decline answering when no relevant information is found.
Additionally, Error Detection Rate (Chen et al.,
2023b) evaluates the model’s capability to identify
and disregard incorrect or misleading information
from retrieved documents. Context Relevance is
another essential metric, assessing the pertinence
of the retrieved documents to the query. It’s vital to
ensure the information used to generate responses
is directly related to the query’s context. Faithfulness (Shahul et al., 2023) measures the accuracy
with which the generated content reflects the information in the retrieved documents, ensuring that
the generation process with no misinformation.
8.2 Generation-based Aspect
Evaluating the quality of text produced by LLMs
involves analyzing their performance on various
downstream tasks using standard metrics. These
metrics assess linguistic quality, coherence, accuracy, and the extent to which the generated text
reflects ground-truth data. Linguistic quality and
coherence are evaluated through metrics such as
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), which measures fluency and similarity to human-produced text, and
ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), which quantifies the overlap with reference summaries to gauge the text’s
capacity to encapsulate main ideas and phrases.
Accuracy and overlap with ground-truth data are
gauged using metrics like EM and F1 Score, which
respectively determine the percentage of answers
that are entirely correct and offer a balanced assessment of precision and recall in retrieving relevant
answers while minimizing inaccuracies.
Beyond these standard metrics, the evaluation
may also incorporate task-specific criteria and
novel metrics tailored to particular applications.
For instance, in dialogue generation, perplexity
and entropy are used to evaluate response diversity and naturalness. Additionally, metrics such as
Misleading Rate and Mistake Reappearance Rate
(Liu et al., 2023) gauge a model’s ability to avoid
misinformation and inaccuracies. Other specialized metrics include Answer Relevance (Shahul
et al., 2023), assessing the precision of responses
to queries; Kendall’s tau (Saad-Falcon et al., 2023),
for evaluating the accuracy of RAG system rankings; Micro-F1 (Saad-Falcon et al., 2023), which
fine-tunes accuracy evaluation in tasks with multiple correct answers; and Prediction Accuracy, directly measuring the alignment of generated answers with expected responses, thereby offering a
direct insight into a system’s effectiveness in generating accurate content.
9 Future Directions
9.1 Retrieval Quality
The integration of RAG into LLMs faces significant
hurdles due to the vast amounts of unreliable information on the internet, including fake news. This
presents a challenge for accurately retrieving useful
knowledge, leading to the unreliable generation of
responses by LLMs. As a result, LLMs may generate content based on incorrect information, undermining their reliability. Recent research efforts
are directed towards enhancing retrieval methods
to improve the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of LLMs in generating accurate and reliable
responses.
Differentiable Search Indices (Tay et al., 2022)
and (Bevilacqua et al., 2022b) developed differentiable search indices that integrate the retrieval
process within a Transformer model, enabling direct mapping of text queries to document identifiers.
These approaches offer superior performance and
potential for more efficient and scalable retrieval.
Generative Models for Search GERE (Chen
et al., 2022a) can directly generate document titles
and evidence sentences for fact-verification tasks.
PARADE (Li et al., 2024) is a method for document
reranking that aggregates passage representations
into a unified document relevance score. Both of
them demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval quality over traditional methods.
Fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models
RankT5 (Zhuang et al., 2023) is a model that finetunes the T5 framework specifically for text ranking. It leverages ranking losses to optimize performance metrics and exhibits promising zero-shot
performance on out-of-domain data.
Noise Power (Cuconasu et al., 2024) provide a
comprehensive analysis of the impact of IR components on RAG systems, revealing that the inclusion
of irrelevant documents can significantly improve
accuracy. It challenges conventional retrieval strategies and underscores the potential for developing
specialized approaches that integrate retrieval with
language generation models.
9.2 Multimodal RAG
The multimodal RAG domain has experienced significant growth, highlighting a pivotal advancement
at the confluence of text and visual comprehension.
The introduction of MuRAG (Chen et al., 2022b)
marked a breakthrough by amalgamating textual
and visual information for language generation, establishing a new standard for multimodal datasets.
This model showcased the efficacy of utilizing a
multimodal memory system to boost the accuracy
in question-answering and reasoning tasks.
After MuRAG, studies such as REVEAL (Hu
et al., 2023) and Re-Imagen (Chen et al., 2023c)
have focused on enhancing visual question answering and text-to-image generation. They achieved
this through the incorporation of dynamic retrieval
mechanisms and the improvement of image fidelity,
respectively. These advancements laid the groundwork for further models by researchers like Sarto
et al. (Sarto et al., 2022) for image captioning,
and Yuan et al. (Yuan et al., 2023) for text-to-audio
generation, broadening the scope of RAG’s application across different modalities and improving the
quality and realism of the generated outputs. Furthermore, Re-ViLM (Yang et al., 2023b) refined
image captioning capabilities through a retrievalaugmented visual language model. By fine-tuning
model parameters and implementing innovative filtering strategies, it has made strides in producing
more precise and contextually appropriate captions.
By tapping into external resources, these models
have provided significant enhancements over traditional benchmarks, highlighting the advantage of
integrating diverse sources of knowledge.
10 Conclusions
In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive framework for understanding the RAG domain, highlighting its significance in enhancing
the capabilities of LLMs. Through a structured
overview of RAG, categorizing various methods,
and an in-depth analysis of its core technologies
and evaluation methods, this study illuminates the
path for future research. It identifies crucial areas
for improvement and outlines potential directions
for advancing RAG applications, especially in textual contexts. This survey aims to elucidate the
core concepts of the RAG field from a retrieval
perspective, and it is intended to facilitate further
exploration and innovation in the accurate retrieval
and generation of information.
11 Limitations
This survey comprehensively examines existing
RAG models, summarizing their core techniques
into four main steps from a retrieval perspective. It
recognizes that some methods may encompass multiple steps and that decoupling these steps could
potentially obscure their intrinsic connections. Nevertheless, the primary objective is to simplify the
complexity of the approach, clearly delineating the
specific problems it addresses. This allows for a
clearer identification of areas ripe for further optimization and improvement. Despite the thorough investigation, the rapid evolution of the field and
page limits mean that certain aspects might not
have been fully analyzed and explored, or recent
developments could have been missed. While the
paper references evaluation methods that can aid
in the development of RAG, it also acknowledges
mature tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex as
useful resources. However, the focus of this survey
is not on detailing the evaluation pipeline or how
these tools are specifically used, but rather on illustrating how evaluation aspects can support the
advancement of RAG. This choice highlights an
area for future work, emphasizing the importance
of methodological clarity and the application of
evaluation tools in refining and enhancing RAG
models.

5,"How to Maximize Your Impact as a Data Scientist

One of the hardest pills to swallow as an Individual Contributor (IC) at work is that nobody cares about the hard work you put in. They don’t even care about your output; they care about the impact you drive.

What’s the difference? Your output is the analysis you deliver, or the lines of code you write. Your impact is the decision your analysis helps the CEO make, or the revenue the new product feature is generating.

If you want to establish yourself as a high performer and accelerate your career as a Data Scientist, it’s key to focus on impact.

In this post I’ll go over the following:
Why prioritizing impact matters not just for managers, but also ICs
Why focusing on impact is hard
How to maximize your impact
How to overcome common challenges in driving real impact
Let’s dive in.

Why should I focus on impact; isn’t that my manager’s job?
Of course you can leave it to your manager to worry about impact. But stepping up comes with some real benefits for your career:

Reduced frustration & burn-out: Putting a lot of work into a project and then feeling like it didn’t move the needle is one of the most frustrating feelings in any job.
Promotions: Promotions are heavily tied to impact. And if you want to become a manager, you’ll need to show that you understand what drives business outcomes and can allocate resources accordingly.
Internal opportunities: People around you notice if you are having an outsized impact, and you’ll increase your chances of receiving internal offers. My promotion to Director happened because the CMO noticed my work on the BizOps team and asked me to move into the Marketing org to build out a Strategy & Analytics team.
External opportunities: Prospective employers don’t focus on what responsibilities you had, but what your impact was. After all, they are trying to figure out how you can help their business.
Why isn’t everyone doing this?
Because it’s hard.

We are used to thinking about inputs and outputs rather than impact in our daily lives (“I went to the gym” or “I did three loads of laundry”) and we carry that mindset over to our jobs.

More importantly, it gives us a sense of control. It’s fully under your control to work hard on the project, and maybe to create the final deliverable, but you can’t guarantee that it will actually move the business forward.

It can also feel like we’re doing someone else’s job. You built the dashboard; now it’s the other team’s problem how they’re going use it and get value from it. You can definitely take this stance; but don’t you want to see your work move the needle?

Lastly, sometimes it’s unclear what impact even looks like for our role because we feel too disconnected from the business outcomes; I’ll get into this below.

How can I become more impact-focused?
Step 1: Understand what impact looks like for your role and measure your success accordingly
Stop thinking about productivity metrics like “I launched 5 experiments” or “I built this model” and hold yourself accountable to driving impact.

But what does that look like for a Data Scientist? For other roles it’s easy; Account Executives have sales quotas and Growth Marketing Managers have lead generation targets.

But Data Science, at its core, is a function that supports other teams. As a result, there are two levels of impact:


Image by author
Did your work change anything for the better for your business partners? E.g.:

Did your analysis change the roll-out strategy of the new product?
Did your model improve forecast accuracy?
Does your dashboard save the team hours every week that they used to spend on manual data pulls?
Did your work help move the needle on downstream business metrics? E.g.:

You’re a Marketing Data Scientist? Assume you’re on the hook for hitting lead and opportunity targets, and improving Marketing efficiency
You’re doing Analytics for the Customer Support org? Start obsessing about response times and satisfaction scores.
You don’t have to be solely responsible for something in order to take (partial) credit for it. If you provided the analysis that resulted in a pricing change that saved the company millions, then you deserve part of the credit for that impact.

You might not feel the consequences of missing these downstream targets as immediately as your stakeholders, but since your long-term career trajectory is still tied to driving impact, it helps to adopt this outcome-focused mindset.

Once you start doing this, you’ll notice more inefficiencies you can help address, or new opportunities for growth.

Step 2: Ensure your work solves a real business problem
You’ll likely know this situation: Instead of approaching you with a problem, people ask you for a specific deliverable. An analysis, a model, a dashboard.

If you blindly execute what they ask, you might realize too late that it won’t lead to tangible business impact. Maybe the problem they are trying to solve is not that important in the grand scheme of things, or there is a better way to approach it.

So what can you do?
Act like an owner. Understand the actual problem behind the request, and ask yourself what business priority this supports.

If you are early in your career then your manager should ideally help with this. But don’t rely on this: Managers don’t always do a perfect job, and you’ll be the one to feel the consequences of badly scoped work.

This requires you to understand company level priorities and the priorities of other orgs and teams. Take notes during All Hands meetings etc. to understand the big picture, and get your hands on other team’s planning materials to get an idea of what they’re trying to accomplish in the next 1–2 quarters.

Step 3: Ensure there is buy-in for your work
Even if your work directly supports company-level priorities, you’ll be in for a bad time if key stakeholders are not bought in.

You don’t want to be in a situation where you finish the work and then realize that another team is blocking the implementation because they have concerns you didn’t address. To avoid this, you’ll:

Need to understand whose support you need, and
Get them onboard from the get-go
This is a complex topic in itself; I’ll write a separate deep dive on how to drive alignment and get buy-in from other teams in the near future.

Step 4: Focus your time on the highest-impact thing
No matter what role you’re in, you’re likely juggling multiple priorities. To maximize your impact, you need to ensure you spend the majority of your time on the most important thing.

As with many things, this is easier said than done though, so let’s talk about what that looks like concretely.

Ad-hoc requests vs. strategic work
It’s easy to get caught up in the craziness of daily business only to realize you didn’t make any progress on the big, strategic project you actually care about.

This is all too common; none of us get to sit in our ivory tower and chip away at our projects undisturbed. Plus, ad-hoc work is impactful, too; while it’s less exciting than strategic projects, it’s what keeps the business running.

Still, if you find yourself spending the majority of your time fielding these ad-hoc issues, it’s time to talk to your manager. I’m sure your manager would rather help protect your bandwidth than have you 1) miss your deadlines on your key projects and 2) quit eventually from frustration.


Image by author
Don’t cry over spilled milk
Another common challenge comes from the sunk cost fallacy. You invested a lot of time into a project, but it doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. Maybe you realized the premise didn’t make as much sense as you thought, or the priorities of the business have changed since you started the work.

Instead of talking to your manager and stakeholders about changing the scope of the project or abandoning it altogether, you’re doubling down to get it over the finish line. After all, you don’t want all of your effort to go to waste. Sound familiar?

Economists (and Poker players) figured out a long time ago that this is a dangerous trap. When prioritizing your time, ignore how much effort your already put in and focus on where the next hour of work will yield the most impact.

Things to watch out for (“impact killers”)
How do you minimize the odds of wasting time on a project that won’t lead to impact? There are a few warning signs:

“Academic” projects: Any time a project is pitched to you along the lines of “This would be interesting to understand” you should be careful; projects that purely improve the understanding of an issue without tying it back to the business are a waste of time and source of frustration in my experience
Overly ambitious project scope: At Uber, everyone always wanted to understand what the “best” driver incentive type is. Many people worked on this over the years, but it never led anywhere. There was no simple “one-size-fits-all” answer to this question, and the projects that led to actual impact were much more concrete, tactical optimizations
The customer or deliverable are not defined: If it’s not clear who the end user of your work is (are you doing this for your manager, leadership, or another team?), or you’re unsure what exactly you’re supposed to deliver, it should raise a red flag. This is typically a sign that the project needs more scoping work before someone should start running with it
Common Challenges and How to Address Them
We talked about general frameworks to maximize impact. But how do you make actual, specific projects more impactful?

Many times, projects fail close to the finish line. Impact doesn’t materialize automatically, so you need to put in the final bit of work to ensure your work gets adopted. Doing this has an extremely high return on the time you invest since you already did the hard work to produce the deliverable and “only” need to close the loop with stakeholders.


Image by author
To make things more tangible, I am going to go through a few types of common deliverables, touch on where they typically fail to create impact and propose what you can do about it:

1. You create a comprehensive analysis but nobody is acting on it
Problem: This is common with analyses that don’t have a clear recommendation. If you simply outline the data and potential paths forward, you are expecting your audience to do all of the heavy lifting.

Solution: Your work starts adding real value for them once you take that work off their plate. Always give a clear recommendation; you can caveat it and show alternatives in the appendix, but you need to take a stance.

2. You ran an experiment but nobody is using the results
Problem: Many experiments conclude with a metrics read-out by Data Science. More often than not, this is a “metrics dump” with a lot of information, but little interpretation or context.

Solution: Help your business partners interpret the results, and tell them how it affects what they care about.

How should they think about the statistical significance or lack thereof?
Is the observed lift good compared to other changes you tested and shipped?
What is your recommendation for next steps? What does the experiment result mean for this person or team specifically?
Remember, you are the subject matter expert and shouldn’t expect non-analytical audiences to interpret raw experiment data. Telling your stakeholders what the result means for them will increase chances they will act on it.

3. You built a predictive model, but the team you built it for is not using it
Problem: When predictive models don’t get used, it’s often because of a lack of trust in the model output.

ML models themselves tend to be black boxes, and if teams don’t understand how the outputs were generated and whether they are reliable, they are hesitant to rely on them. Even if your model is not using ML and lives in a spreadsheet: If people don’t know how it works, they’ll be suspicious.

Solution: It’s all about involving stakeholders in the process and building trust.

Involve stakeholders in the model development from the get-go to get them comfortable and address any concerns early on
Demystify the output; for example, you can extract the top model features and explain them
Sanity-check predictions and compare them to intuition. For example, if you forecast sales but your model predicts a different seasonality pattern from previous years, you’ll need to be able to explain why, or you’ll lose trust. In my experience, this is more impactful than just sharing performance metrics like the accuracy of the model
Having a structured playbook for how to do this will make your life easier, so I’ll cover this in a separate post in the near future.

4. You created a dashboard but nobody is looking at it
Problem: If a dashboard doesn’t get used, it’s likely one of these things is true:

The dashboard doesn’t directly address an urgent business use case
You didn’t involve your stakeholders along the way (e.g. by sharing mock-ups and drafts for feedback) and the final product is not what they were hoping for
The dashboard is complex and your users don’t understand how to get what they need
Solution: To address #1 and #2, start with user research to understand pain points and potential use cases of the dashboard, and involve your stakeholders during development.

With regards to #3, a simpler dashboard that users are comfortable with beats a more advanced one that doesn’t get used. If you cannot (or don’t want to) simplify the dash further, you’ll need to train your users on the functionality and shadow them to understand any points of friction.

A dashboard is not done when you ship it for the first time, but needs to be improved over time based on users’ needs and feedback.

Closing Thoughts
Focusing on impact is scary since we leave the world of controllable inputs behind, but it’s what ultimately gets you promotions and new job opportunities.

And isn’t it nice when your work actually feels like it moves the needle?

4,"Recipes
This page includes code snippets or “recipes” for a variety of common tasks. Use them as building blocks or examples when making your own notebooks.

In these recipes, each code block represents a cell.

Control Flow
Show an output conditionally
Use cases. Hide an output until a condition is met (e.g., until algorithm parameters are valid), or show different outputs depending on the value of a UI element or some other Python object

Recipe.

Use an if expression to choose which output to show.

# condition is a boolean, True of False
condition = True
""condition is True"" if condition else None
Run a cell on a timer
Use cases.

Load new data periodically, and show updated plots or other outputs. For example, in a dashboard monitoring a training run, experiment trial, real-time weather data, …

Run a job periodically

Recipe.

Import packages

import marimo as mo
Create a mo.ui.refresh timer that fires once a second:

refresh = mo.ui.refresh(default_interval=""1s"")
# This outputs a timer that fires once a second
refresh
Reference the timer by name to make this cell run once a second

import random

# This cell will run once a second!
refresh

mo.md(""#"" + """" * random.randint(1, 10))
Require form submission before sending UI value
Use cases. UI elements automatically send their values to the Python when they are interacted with, and run all cells referencing the elements. This makes marimo notebooks responsive, but it can be an issue when the downstream cells are expensive, or when the input (such as a text box) needs to be filled out completely before it is considered valid. Forms let you gate submission of UI element values on manual confirmation, via a button press.

Recipe.

Import packages

import marimo as mo
Create a submittable form.

form = mo.ui.text(label=""Your name"").form()
form
Get the value of the form.

form.value
Stop execution of a cell and its descendants
Use cases. For example, don’t run a cell or its descendants if a form is unsubmitted.

Recipe.

Import packages

import marimo as mo
Create a submittable form.

form = mo.ui.text(label=""Your name"").form()
form
Use mo.stop to stop execution when the form is unsubmitted.

mo.stop(form.value is None, mo.md(""Submit the form to continue""))

mo.md(f""Hello, {form.value}!"")
Grouping UI elements together
Create an array of UI elements
Use cases. In order to synchronize UI elements between the frontend and backend (Python), marimo requires you to assign UI elements to global variables. But sometimes you don’t know the number of elements to make until runtime: for example, maybe you want o make a list of sliders, and the number of sliders to make depends on the value of some other UI element.

You might be tempted to create a Python list of UI elements, such as l = [mo.ui.slider(1, 10) for i in range(number.value)]: however, this won’t work, because the sliders are not bound to global variables.

For such cases, marimo provides the “higher-order” UI element mo.ui.array, which lets you make a new UI element out of a list of UI elements: l = mo.ui.array([mo.ui.slider(1, 10) for i in range(number.value)]). The value of an array element is a list of the values of the elements it wraps (in this case, a list of the slider values). Any time you interact with any of the UI elements in the array, all cells referencing the array by name (in this case, “l”) will run automatically.

Recipe.

Import packages.

import marimo as mo
Use mo.ui.array to group together many UI elements into a list.

import random

# instead of random.randint, in your notebook you'd use the value of
# an upstream UI element or other Python object
array = mo.ui.array([mo.ui.text() for i in range(random.randint(1, 10))])
array
Get the value of the UI elements using array.value

array.value
Create a dictionary of UI elements
Use cases. Same as for creating an array of UI elements, but lets you name each of the wrapped elements with a string key.

Recipe.

Import packages.

import marimo as mo
Use mo.ui.dictionary to group together many UI elements into a list.

import random

# instead of random.randint, in your notebook you'd use the value of
# an upstream UI element or other Python object
dictionary = mo.ui.dictionary({str(i): mo.ui.text() for i in range(random.randint(1, 10))})
dictionary
Get the value of the UI elements using dictionary.value

dictionary.value
Embed a dynamic number of UI elements in another output
Use cases. When you want to embed a dynamic number of UI elements in other outputs (like tables or markdown).

Recipe.

Import packages

import marimo as mo
Group the elements with mo.ui.dictionary or mo.ui.array, then retrieve them from the container and display them elsewhere.

import random

n_items = random.randint(2, 5)

# Create a dynamic number of elements using `mo.ui.dictionary` and
# `mo.ui.array`
elements = mo.ui.dictionary(
    {
        ""checkboxes"": mo.ui.array([mo.ui.checkbox() for _ in range(n_items)]),
        ""texts"": mo.ui.array(
            [mo.ui.text(placeholder=""task ..."") for _ in range(n_items)]
        ),
    }
)

mo.md(
    f""""""
    Here's a TODO list of {n_items} items\n\n
    """"""
    + ""\n\n"".join(
        # Iterate over the elements and embed them in markdown
        [
            f""{checkbox} {text}""
            for checkbox, text in zip(
                elements[""checkboxes""], elements[""texts""]
            )
        ]
    )
)
Get the value of the elements

elements.value
Create a hstack (or vstack) of UI elements with on_change handlers
Use cases. Arrange a dynamic number of UI elements in a hstack or vstack, for example some number of buttons, and execute some side-effect when an element is interacted with, e.g. when a button is clicked.

Recipe.

mo.md(""#"" + """" * button.value) if button.value > 0 else None
Caching
Cache expensive computations
Use case. Because marimo runs cells automatically as code and UI elements change, it can be helpful to cache expensive intermediate computations. For example, perhaps your notebook computes t-SNE, UMAP, or PyMDE embeddings, and exposes their parameters as UI elements. Caching the embeddings for different configurations of the elements would greatly speed up your notebook.

Recipe.

Use functools to cache function outputs given inputs.

import functools

@functools.cache
def compute_predictions(problem_parameters):
   # replace with your own function/parameters
   ...
Whenever compute_predictions is called with a value of problem_parameters it has not seen, it will compute the predictions and store them in a cache. The next time it is called with the same parameters, instead of recomputing the predictions, it will return the previously computed value from the cache.

The first step to training an LLM is collecting a large corpus of text data and then tokenizing it. Tokenization is the process of mapping text to integers, which can be fed into the LLM. Our training corpus for this model will be the works of Shakespeare concatenated into one file. This is roughly 1 million characters and looks like this:

First Citizen:
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

All:
Speak, speak.

First Citizen:
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

All:
Resolved. resolved.

First Citizen:
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
...
First, we read the file as a single long string into the text variable. Then we use the set() function to get all the unique characters in the text which will be our vocabulary. By printing vocab you can see all the characters in our vocabulary as one string, and we have a total of 65 characters which till be our tokens.

# Creating the vocabulary
with open('input.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    text = f.read()
vocab = sorted(list(set(text)))
vocab_size = len(vocab)

print(''.join(vocab))
# !$&',-.3:;?ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
print(vocab_size)
# 65
Production models will use tokenization algorithms like byte-pair encoding to generate a larger vocabulary of sub-word chunks. Since our focus today is on the architecture, we will continue with character-level tokenization. Next, we will map our vocabulary to integers known as token IDs. Then we can encode our text into tokens and decode them back to a string.

# Create mapping from vocab to integers
itos = {i:c for i,c in enumerate(vocab)} # int to string
stoi = {c:i for i,c in enumerate(vocab)} # string to int
encode = lambda x: [stoi[c] for c in x]
decode = lambda x: ''.join([itos[i] for i in x])

print(encode(""hello world""))
# [46, 43, 50, 50, 53, 1, 61, 53, 56, 50, 42]
print(decode(encode(""hello world"")))
# hello world
We use theenumerate() function to iterate over all characters and their index in the vocabulary and create a dictionary itos which maps integers to characters and stoi which maps strings to integers. Then we use these mappings to create our encode and decode functions. Now we can encode the entire text and split training and validation data.

data = encode(text)
split = int(0.9 * len(data))
train_data = data[:split]
val_data = data[split:]
Currently, our training data is just a very long string of tokens. However, we are trying to train our model to predict the next token some given previous tokens. Therefore our dataset should be comprised of examples where the input is some string of tokens and the label is the correct next token. We need to define a model parameter called context length which is the maximum number of tokens used to predict the next token. Our training examples will be the length of our context length.

Let’s look at the first ctx_len+1 tokens.

ctx_len = 8
print(train_data[:ctx_len + 1])
# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47, 58]
# x: [18, 47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47] | y: 58
This is one training example where the input is “18, 47, 56, 57, 58, 1, 15, 47” and the desired output is “58”. This is 8 tokens of context. However, we also want to train the model to predict the next token given only 7, 6, 5 … 0 tokens as context which is needed during generation. Therefore we also consider the 8 sub examples packed into this example:

ctx_len = 8
print(train_data[:ctx_len + 1])
# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47, 58]
# 8 sub examples
# [18] --> 47
# [18, 47] --> 56
# [18, 47, 56] --> 57
# [18, 47, 56, 57] --> 58
# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58] --> 1
# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58, 1] --> 15
# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58, 1, 15] --> 47
# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58, 1, 15, 47] --> 58
Notice that the labels are simply the inputs shifted left.

print(""inputs: "", train_data[:ctx_len])
print(""labels: "", train_data[1:ctx_len+1]) # labels = inputs indexed 1 higher
# inputs: [18, 47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47]
# labels: [47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47, 58]
At index 0 the input is 18 and the label is 47. At index 1 the input is everything before and including index 1 which is [18, 47] and the label is 56, etc. Now that we understand that the labels are simply the input sequence indexed one higher we can build our datasets.

# Creating training and validation datasets
ctx_len = 8
X_train = mx.array([train_data[i:i+ctx_len] for i in range(0, len(train_data) - ctx_len, ctx_len)])
y_train = mx.array([train_data[i+1:i+ctx_len+1] for i in range(0, len(train_data) - ctx_len, ctx_len)])
X_val = mx.array([val_data[i:i+ctx_len] for i in range(0, len(val_data) - ctx_len, ctx_len)])
y_val = mx.array([val_data[i+1:i+ctx_len+1] for i in range(0, len(val_data) - ctx_len, ctx_len)])
We loop through the data and take chunks of size ctx_len as the inputs (X) and then take the same chunks but at 1 higher index as the labels (y). Then we take these Python lists and create mlx array objects from them. The model internals will be written with mlx so we want our inputs to be mlx arrays.

One more thing. During training we don’t want to feed the model one example at a time, we want to feed it multiple examples in parallel for efficiency. This group of examples is called our batch, and the number of examples in a group is our batch size. Thus we define a function to generate batches for training.

def get_batches(X, y, b_size, shuffle=True):
    if shuffle:
        ix = np.arange(X.shape[0])
        np.random.shuffle(ix)
        ix = mx.array(ix)
        X = X[ix]
        y = y[ix]
    for i in range(0, X.shape[0], b_size):
        input = X[i:i+b_size]
        label = y[i:i+b_size]
        yield input, label
If shuffle=True, we shuffle the data by indexing it with a randomly shuffled index. Then we loop through our dataset and return batch-size chunks from input and label datasets. These chunks are known as mini-batches and are just stacked examples that we process in parallel. These mini-batches will be our input to the model during training.

Here’s an example of a minibatch of 4 examples with context length 8.


A single minibatch (image by author)
This minibatch packs 32 next-token prediction problems. The model will predict the next token for each token in the input and the labels will be used to calculate the loss. Notice that the labels contain the next token for each index of the inputs.

You’ll want to keep this picture in your mind because the shapes of these tensors will get hairy. For now, just remember that we will input a tensor of shape (batch_size, ctx_len) to the model.

Coding GPT-2
Let’s look at the GPT-2 architecture to get an overview of what we are trying to implement.


GPT-2 Architecture (image by author)
Don’t worry if this looks confusing. We will implement it step by step from bottom to top. Let’s start by implementing the input embeddings.

Input Embeddings
The purpose of the input embedding layer is to map token IDs to vectors. Each token will be mapped to a vector which will be its representation as it is forwarded through the model. The vectors for each token will accumulate and exchange information as they pass through the model and eventually be used to predict the next token. These vectors are called embeddings.

The simplest way to map token IDs to vectors is through a lookup table. We create a matrix of size (vocab_size, n_emb) where each row is the embedding vector for the corresponding token. This matrix is known as the embedding weights.


Embedding Layer (image by author)
The diagram shows an example embedding layer of size (65, 6). This means there are 65 tokens in the vocabulary and each one will be represented by a length 6 embedding vector. The inputted sequence will be used to index the embedding weights to get the vector corresponding to each token. Remember the minibatches we input into the model? Originally the minibatch is size (batch_size, ctx_len). After passing through the embedding layer it is size (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb). Instead of each token being a single integer, each token is now a vector of length n_emb.

Let’s define the embedding layer in code now.

n_emb = 6 # You can add these hyperparams at the top of your file
class GPT(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.wte = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_emb)
We will define a class to organize our implementation. We subclass nn.Module to take advantage of mlx’s features. Then in the init function, we call the superclass constructor and initialize our token embedding layer called wte .

Positional Embeddings
Next up is the positional embeddings. The purpose of positional embeddings is to encode information about the position of each token in the sequence. This can be added to our input embeddings to get a complete representation of each token that contains information about the token’s position in the sequence.

class GPT(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.wte = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_emb) # token embeddings
        self.wpe = nn.Embedding(ctx_len, n_emb) # position embeddings
The position embeddings work the same as token embeddings, except instead of having a row for each token we have a row for each possible position index. This means our embedding weights will be of shape (ctx_len, n_emb). Now we implement the __call__ function in our GPT class. This function will contain the forward pass of the model.

# Tensor shapes commented
def __call__(self, x):
    B, T = x.shape # (B = batch_size, T = ctx_len)
    tok_emb = self.wte(x) # (B, T, n_emb)
    pos_emb = self.wpe(mx.arange(T)) # (T, n_emb)
    x = tok_emb + pos_emb # (B, T, n_emb)
First, we break out the dimensions of our input into variables B and T for easy handling. In sequence modeling contexts B and T are usually used as shorthand for “batch” and “time” dimensions. In this case, the “time” dimension of our sequence is the context length.

Next, we calculate token and position embeddings. Notice that for the position embeddings, our input is mx.arange(T) . This will output an array of consecutive integers from 0 to T-1 which is exactly what we want because those are the positions we want to embed. After passing that through the embedding layer we will have a tensor of shape (T, n_emb) because the embedding layer plucks out the n_emb length vector for each of the T positions. Note that even though pos_emb is not the same shape as tok_emb we can add the two because mlx will broadcast, or replicate pos_emb across the batch dimension to allow elementwise addition. Finally, we perform the addition to get the new representations of the tokens with positional information.

Self-Attention
So far the representation vectors for each token have been calculated independently. They have not had the opportunity to exchange any information. This is intuitively bad in language modeling because the meaning and usage of words depend on the surrounding context. Self-attention is how we incorporate information from previous tokens into a given token.

First, let’s consider a naive approach. What if we simply represented each token as the average of its representation vector and the vectors of all the tokens before it? This achieves our goal of packing information from previous tokens into the representation for a given token. Here’s what it would look like.


image by author
But self-attention doesn’t involve writing a for-loop. The key insight is we can achieve this previous token averaging with matrix multiplication!


image by author
By multiplying our input sequence on the left by a special matrix we get the desired result. This matrix is known as the attention weights. Notice that each row of the attention weight matrix specificies “how much” of each other token goes into the representation for any given token. For example in row two, we have [0.5, 0.5, 0, 0]. This means that row two of the result will be 0.5*token1 + 0.5*token2 + 0*token3 + 0*token4 , or the average of token1 and token2. Note that the attention weights are a lower-triangular matrix (zeros in upper right entries). This ensures that future tokens will not be included in the representation of a given token. This ensures that tokens can only communicate with the previous tokens because during generation the model will only have access to previous tokens.

Let’s look at how we can construct the attention weight matrix.


image by author
Notice that if we create an array of zeros with -inf in the upper right entries and then perform row-wise softmax we get the desired attention weights. A good exercise is to step through the softmax calculation for a row to see how this works. The takeaway is that we can take some array of size (ctx_len, ctx_len) and softmax each row to get attention weights that sum to one.

Now we can leave the realm of naive self-attention. Instead of simply averaging previous tokens, we use arbitrary weighted sums over previous tokens. Notice what happens when we do row-wise softmax of an arbitrary matrix.


image by author
We still get weights that sum to one on each row. During training, we can learn the numbers in the matrix on the left which will specify how much each token goes into the representation for another token. This is how tokens pay “attention” to each other. But we still haven’t understood where this matrix on the left came from. These pre-softmax attention weights are calculated from the tokens themselves, but indirectly through three linear projections.

Keys, Queries, and Values

image by author
Each token in our sequence emits 3 new vectors. These vectors are called keys, queries, and values. We use the dot product of the query vector of one token and the key vector of another token to quantify the “affinity” those two tokens have. We want to calculate the pairwise affinities of each token with every other token, therefore we multiply the query vector (4x3) with the key vector transposed (3x4) to get the raw attention weights (4x4). Due to the way matrix multiplication works the (i,j) entry in the raw attention weights will be the query of token i dot the key of token j or the “affinity” between the two. Thus we have calculated interactions between every token. However, we don’t want past tokens interacting with future tokens so we apply a mask of -inf to the upper right entries to ensure they will zero out after softmax. Then we perform row-wise softmax to get the final attention weights. Instead of multiplying these weights directly with the input, we multiply them with the value projection. This results in the new representations.

Now that we understand attention conceptually, let’s implement it.

class Attention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, head_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.head_size = head_size
        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)

We start by defining the key, query, and value projection layers. Note that instead of going from n_emb to n_emb, we project from n_emb to head_size. This doesn’t change anything, it just means the new representations calculated by attention will be dimension head_size.

class Attention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, head_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.head_size = head_size
        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
    def __call__(self, x): # shapes commented
        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)
        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
The forward pass begins by calculating the key, query, and value projections. We also break out the input shape into the variables B, T, and C for future convenience.

class Attention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, head_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.head_size = head_size
        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
    def __call__(self, x):
        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)
        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 2, 1])) / math.sqrt(self.head_size)
        # attn_weights.shape = (B, T, T)
Next, we calculate the attention weights. We only want to transpose the last two dimensions of the key tensor, because the batch dimension is just there so we can forward multiple training examples in parallel. The mlx transpose function expects the new order of the dimensions as input, so we pass it [0, 2, 1] to transpose the last two dimensions. One more thing: we scale the attention weights by the inverse square root of head_size. This is known as scaled attention and the purpose is to ensure that when Q and K are unit variance, attn_weights will be unit variance. If the variance of attn_weights is high, then the softmax will map these small and large values to 0 or 1which results in less complex representations.

The next step is to apply the mask to ensure we are doing causal language modeling i.e. ensuring tokens cannot attend to future tokens.

class Attention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, head_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.head_size = head_size
        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)
        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick
        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9
    def __call__(self, x):
        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)
        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 2, 1])) / math.sqrt(self.head_size)
        # attn_weights.shape = (B, T, T)
We create the mask with a clever broadcasting trick. Let’s say our ctx_len=4 like in the diagrams above. First, we use mx.arange(4) to set the indices variable to [0, 1, 2, 3].


image by author
Then we can index like so indices[:, None] to generate a column vector with the values of indices. Similarly, we can get a row vector using indices[None]. Then when we do the < comparison, mlx broadcasts the vectors because they have mismatching shapes so they can’t be compared elementwise. Broadcasting means mlx will replicate the vectors along the lacking dimension. This results in an elementwise comparison of two (4, 4) matrices which makes sense. Side note: I recommend familiarizing yourself with the details of broadcasting by reading this, it comes up all the time when dealing with tensors.

After the elementwise comparison, we are left with the following tensor:

[[False,  True,  True,  True],
 [False, False,  True,  True],
 [False, False, False,  True],
 [False, False, False, False]]
Multiplying this tensor by -1e9, we get:

[[-0e+00, -1e+09, -1e+09, -1e+09],
 [-0e+00, -0e+00, -1e+09, -1e+09],
 [-0e+00, -0e+00, -0e+00, -1e+09],
 [-0e+00, -0e+00, -0e+00, -0e+00]]
Now we have an additive mask. We can add this matrix to our attention weights to make all the upper right entries very large negative numbers. This will cause them to be zeroed out after the softmax operation. Also, note that we add “_” as a prefix to the attribute name _causal_mask which marks it as a private variable. This signals to mlx that it is not a parameter and should not be updated during training.

class Attention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, head_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.head_size = head_size
        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)
        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick
        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9
    def __call__(self, x):
        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)
        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 2, 1])) / math.sqrt(self.head_size)
        # attn_weights.shape = (B, T, T)
        attn_weights = attn_weights + self._causal_mask
        attn_weights = mx.softmax(attn_weights, axis=-1)
        o = (attn_weights @ V) # (B, T, head_size)
Now we can softmax row-wise to get the final attention weights and multiply these weights by the values to get our output. Note we pass axis=-1 to softmax which specifies that we want to softmax across the last dimension which are the rows.

The final step is output linear projection and dropout.

dropout = 0.1 # add this with hyperparams at top of file
class Attention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, head_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.head_size = head_size
        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)
        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick
        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9
        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(head_size, n_emb) # output projection
        self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
    def __call__(self, x):
        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)
        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 2, 1])) / math.sqrt(self.head_size)
        # attn_weights.shape = (B, T, T)
        attn_weights = attn_weights + self._causal_mask
        attn_weights = mx.softmax(attn_weights, axis=-1)
        o = (attn_weights @ V) # (B, T, head_size)
        o = self.c_proj(self.resid_dropout(o))
        return o
We add two new layers, c_proj and resid_dropout which are the output projection and residual dropout. The output projection is to return the vectors to their original dimension n_emb. The dropout is added for regularization and training stability which is important as we start layering the transformer blocks to get a deep network. And that’s it for implementing one attention head!

Multi-Head Attention
Instead of having just one attention head LLMs often use multiple attention heads in parallel and concatenate their outputs to create the final representation. For example, let’s say we had one attention head with head_size=64 so the vector it produced for each token was 64 dimensional. We could achieve the same thing with 4 parallel attention heads each with head_size=16 by concatenating their outputs to produce a 16x4 = 64 dimensional output. Multi-head attention allows the model to learn more complex representations because each head learns different projections and attention weights.

n_heads = 4
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module): # naive implementation
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.heads = [Attention(head_size // n_heads) for _ in range(n_heads)]
    def __call__(self, x):
        return mx.concatenate([head(x) for head in self.heads], axis=-1)
The straightforward implementation is to create a list of n_heads attention heads where each one has size equal to our final head size divided by n_heads. Then we concatenate the output of each head over the last axis. However, this implementation is inefficient and does not take advantage of the speed of tensors. Let’s implement multi-head attention with the power of tensors.

head_size = 64 # put at top of file
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)
        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick
        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9
        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(head_size, n_emb) # output projection
        self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
    def __call__(self, x):
        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)
        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
We start with our single-head attention implementation. The __init__() function has not changed. The forward pass begins as normal with the creation of the key, query, and value projections.

head_size = 64 # put at top of file
n_heads = 8 # put at top of file
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)
        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick
        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9
        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(head_size, n_emb) # output projection
        self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
    def __call__(self, x):
        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)
        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        mha_shape = (B, T, n_heads, head_size//n_heads)
        K = mx.as_strided(K, (mha_shape)) # (B, T, n_heads, head_size//n_heads)
        Q = mx.as_strided(Q, (mha_shape)) # (B, T, n_heads, head_size//n_heads)
        V = mx.as_strided(V, (mha_shape)) # (B, T, n_heads, head_size//n_heads)
The next thing we need to do is introduce a new dimension for the number of heads n_heads . In the naive implementation, we had separate attention objects each with their own key, query, and value tensors but now we have them all in one tensor, therefore we need a dimension for the heads. We define the new shape we want in mha_shape . Then we use mx.as_strided() to reshape each tensor to have the head dimension. This function is equivalent to view from pytorch and tells mlx to treat this array as a different shape. But we still have a problem. Notice that we if try to multiply Q @ K_t (where K_t is K transposed over it’s last 2 dims) to compute attention weights as we did before, we will be multiplying the following shapes:

(B, T, n_heads, head_size//n_heads) @ (B, T, head_size//n_heads, n_heads)
Result shape: (B, T, n_heads, n_heads)
This would result in a tensor of shape (B, T, n_heads, n_heads) which is incorrect. With one head our attention weights were shape (B, T, T) which makes sense because it gives us the interaction between each pair of tokens. So now our shape should be the same but with a heads dimension: (B, n_heads, T, T) . We achieve this by transposing the dimensions of keys, queries, and values after we reshape them to make n_heads dimension 1 instead of 2.

head_size = 64 # put at top of file
n_heads = 8 # put at top of file
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)
        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick
        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9
        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(head_size, n_emb) # output projection
        self.attn_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
    def __call__(self, x):
        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)
        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        mha_shape = (B, T, n_heads, head_size//n_heads)
        K = mx.as_strided(K, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size//n_heads)
        Q = mx.as_strided(Q, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size//n_heads)
        V = mx.as_strided(V, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size//n_heads)
        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 1, 3, 2])) / math.sqrt(Q.shape[-1]) # (B, n_heads, T, T)
        attn_weights = attn_weights + self._causal_mask[:T, :T]
        attn_weights = mx.softmax(attn_weights, axis=-1)
        attn_weights = self.attn_dropout(attn_weights)
        o = (attn_weights @ V) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size//n_heads)

Now we can calculate the correction attention weights. Notice that we scale the attention weights by the size of an individual attention head rather than head_size which would be the size after concatenation. We also apply dropout to the attention weights.

Finally, we perform the concatenation and apply the output projection and dropout.

head_size = 64 # put at top of file
n_heads = 8 # put at top of file

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)
        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)

        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick
        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9
        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(head_size, n_emb) # output projection
        self.attn_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
    def __call__(self, x):
        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)
        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)
        mha_shape = (B, T, n_heads, head_size//n_heads)
        K = mx.as_strided(K, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size//n_heads)
        Q = mx.as_strided(Q, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size//n_heads)
        V = mx.as_strided(V, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size//n_heads)
        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 1, 3, 2])) / math.sqrt(Q.shape[-1]) # (B, n_heads, T, T)
        attn_weights = attn_weights + self._causal_mask[:T, :T]
        attn_weights = mx.softmax(attn_weights, axis=-1)
        attn_weights = self.attn_dropout(attn_weights)
        o = (attn_weights @ V) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size//n_heads)
        o = o.transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]).reshape((B, T, head_size)) # concat heads
        o = self.c_proj(self.resid_dropout(o))
        return o
Since we have everything in one tensor, we can do some shape manipulation to do the concatenation. First, we move n_heads back to the second to last dimension with the transpose function. Then we reshape back to the original size to undo the splitting into heads we performed earlier. This is the same as concatenating the final vectors from each head. And that’s it for multi-head attention! We’ve gotten through the most intense part of our implementation.

MLP
The next part of the architecture is the multilayer perception or MLP. This is a fancy way of saying 2 stacked linear layers. There’s not much to be said here, it is a standard neural network.

class MLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.c_fc = nn.Linear(n_emb, 4 * n_emb)
        self.gelu = nn.GELU()
        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(4 * n_emb, n_emb)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
    def __call__(self, x):
        x = self.gelu(self.c_fc(x))
        x = self.c_proj(x)
        x = self.dropout(x)
        return x
We take the input and project it to a higher dimension with c_fc . Then we apply gelu nonlinearity and project it back down to the embedding dimension with c_proj . Finally, we apply dropout and return. The purpose of the MLP is to allow for some computation after the vectors have communicated during attention. We will stack these communication layers (attention) and computation layers (mlp) into a block.

Block
A GPT block consists of attention followed by an MLP. These blocks will be repeated to make the architecture deep.

class Block(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.mlp = MLP()
        self.mha = MultiHeadAttention()
    def __call__(self, x):
        x = self.mha(x)
        x = self.mlp(x)
        return x
Now, we need to add two more features to improve training stability. Let’s take a look at the architecture diagram again.

Layernorms and Skip Connections

image by author
We still need to implement the components highlighted in red. The arrows are skip connections. Instead of the input being transformed directly, the effect of the attention and MLP layers is additive. Their result is added to the input instead of directly replacing it. This is good for the training stability of deep networks since in the backward pass, the operands of an addition operation will receive the same gradient as their sum. Gradients can thus flow backwards freely which prevents issues like vanishing/exploding gradients that plague deep networks. Layernorm also helps with training stability by ensuring activations are normally distributed. Here is the final implementation.

class Block(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.mlp = MLP()
        self.mha = MultiHeadAttention()
        self.ln_1 = nn.LayerNorm(dims=n_emb)
        self.ln_2 = nn.LayerNorm(dims=n_emb)
    def __call__(self, x):
        x = x + self.mha(self.ln_1(x))
        x = x + self.mlp(self.ln_2(x))
        return x
Layernorm is applied before multi-head attention and MLP. The skip connections are added with x = x + ... making the operations additive.

Forward Pass
With the Block defined, we can finish the full GPT-2 forward pass.

n_layers = 3 # put at top of file
class GPT(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.wte = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_emb) # token embeddings
        self.wpe = nn.Embedding(ctx_len, n_emb) # position embeddings
        self.blocks = nn.Sequential(
            *[Block() for _ in range(n_layers)],
        ) # transformer blocks
        self.ln_f = nn.LayerNorm(dims=n_emb) # final layernorm
        self.lm_head = nn.Linear(n_emb, vocab_size) # output projection
    # Tensor shapes commented
    def __call__(self, x):
        B, T = x.shape # (B = batch_size, T = ctx_len)
        tok_emb = self.wte(x) # (B, T, n_emb)
        pos_emb = self.wpe(mx.arange(T)) # (T, n_emb)
        x = tok_emb + pos_emb # (B, T, n_emb)
        x = self.blocks(x) # (B, T, n_emb)
        x = self.ln_f(x) # (B, T, b_emb)
        logits = self.lm_head(x) # (B, T, vocab_size)
        return logits
We create a container for the blocks using nn.Sequential which takes any input and passes it sequentially through the contained layers. Then we can apply all the blocks with self.blocks(x) . Finally, we apply a layer norm and then the lm_head. The lm_head or language modeling head is just a linear layer that maps from the embedding dimension to the vocab size. The model will output a vector containing some value for each word in our vocabulary, or the logits. We can softmax the logits to get a probability distribution over the vocabulary which we can sample from to get the next token. We will also use the logits to calculate the loss during training. There are just two more things we need to implement before we begin training.

Sampling
We need to write a generate function to sample from the model once training is complete. The idea is that we start with some sequence of our choice, then we predict the next token and append this to our sequence. Then we feed the new sequence in and predict the next token again. This continues until we decide to stop.

# method of GPT class
def generate(self, max_new_tokens):
  ctx = mx.zeros((1, 1), dtype=mx.int32)
We prompt the model with a single token, zero. Zero is the newline character so it is a natural place to start the generation since we just want to see how Shakespeare-like our model can get. Note that we initialize the shape to (1, 1) to simulate a single batch with a sequence length of one.

# method of GPT class
def generate(self, max_new_tokens):
  ctx = mx.zeros((1, 1), dtype=mx.int32)
  for _ in range(max_new_tokens):
    logits = self(ctx[:, -ctx_len:]) # pass in last ctx_len characters
    logits = logits[:, -1, :] # get logits for the next token
    next_tok = mx.random.categorical(logits, num_samples=1)
    ctx = mx.concatenate((ctx, next_tok), axis=1)
return ctx
Then we get the logits for the next token by passing in the last ctx_len characters to the model. However, our model output is of shape (B, T, vocab_size) since it predicts the next token logits for each token in the input. We use all of that during training, but now we only want the logits for the last token because we can use this to sample a new token. Therefore we index the logits to get the last element in the first dimension which is the sequence dimension. Then we sample the next token using the mx.random.categorical() function which takes the logits and the number of samples we want as input. This function will softmax the logits to turn them into a probability distribution and then randomly sample a token according to the probabilities. Finally, we concatenate the new token to the context and repeat the process max_new_tokens number of times.

Initialization
The last thing to do is handle weight initialization which is important for training dynamics.

# method of GPT
def _init_parameters(self):
    normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)
    residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 / math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))
First, we define two different nn.init.normal functions. The first one is for initializing all linear and embedding layers. The second one is for initializing linear layers that are specifically residual projections i.e. the last linear layer inside multi-head attention and MLP. The reason for this special initialization is that it checks accumulation along the residual path as model depth increases according to the GPT-2 paper [2].

In mlx we can change the parameters of the model using the mx.update() function. Checking the docs, it expects a complete or partial dictionary of the new model parameters. We can see what this dictionary looks like by printing out self.parameters() inside the GPT class.

       ...
It’s a nested dictionary containing each model weight as an mx.array. So to initialize the parameters of our model we need to build up a dictionary like this with our new params and pass them to self.update() . We can achieve this as follows:

# method of GPT
def _init_parameters(self):
    normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)
    residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 / math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))
    new_params = []
    for name, module in self.named_modules():
        if isinstance(module, nn.layers.linear.Linear):
            new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))
        elif isinstance(module, nn.layers.embedding.Embedding):
            new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)
We maintain a list of tuples called new_params which will contain tuples of (parameter_name, new_value). Next, we loop through each nn.Module object in our model with self.named_modules() which returns tuples of (name, module). If we print out the module names within the loop we see that they look like this:

lm_head
blocks
blocks.layers.4
blocks.layers.3
blocks.layers.3.ln_2
blocks.layers.3.ln_1
blocks.layers.3.mha
blocks.layers.3.mha.resid_dropout
blocks.layers.3.mha.c_proj
blocks.layers.3.mha.attn_dropout
blocks.layers.3.mha.c_attn
...
blocks.layers.0.mlp.dropout
blocks.layers.0.mlp.c_proj
blocks.layers.0.mlp.gelu
blocks.layers.0.mlp.c_fc
wpe
wte
We use the isinstance() function to find the linear and embedding layers and then add them to our list. For example, say we are looping and reach “blocks.layers.0.mlp.c_fc” which is the first linear layer in the MLP. This would trigger the first if statement, and the tuple (""block.layers.0.mlp.c_fc.weight"", [<normally initialized weight here>]) would be added to our list. We have to add “.weight” to the name because we specifically want to initialize the weight in this way, not the bias. Now we need to handle the residual projection initialization.

# method of GPT
def _init_parameters(self):
    normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)
    residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 / math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))
    new_params = []
    for name, module in self.named_modules():
        if isinstance(module, nn.layers.linear.Linear):
            if 'c_proj' in name: # residual projection
                new_params.append((name + '.weight', residual_init(module.weight)))
            else:
                new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))
        elif isinstance(module, nn.layers.embedding.Embedding):
            new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))
After checking if the module is a linear layer, we check if “c_proj” is in the name because that’s how we named the residual projections. Then we can apply the special initialization. Finally, we need to initialize the biases to be zero.

# method of GPT
def _init_parameters(self):
    normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)
    residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 / math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))
    new_params = []
    for name, module in self.named_modules():
        if isinstance(module, nn.layers.linear.Linear):
            if 'c_proj' in name:
                new_params.append((name + '.weight', residual_init(module.weight)))
            else:
                new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))
            if 'bias' in module:
                new_params.append((name + '.bias', mx.zeros(module.bias.shape)))
        elif isinstance(module, nn.layers.embedding.Embedding):
            new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))
    self = self.update(utils.tree_unflatten(new_params))
We add another if statement under our linear branch to check if the nn.Module object has a bias attribute. If it does, we add it to the list initialized to zeros. Finally, we need to transform our list of tuples into a nested dictionary. Luckily mlx has some functions implemented for dealing with parameter dictionaries, and we can use util.tree_unflatten() to convert this list of tuples to a nested parameter dictionary. This is passed into the update method to initialize the parameters. Now we can call _init_parameters() in the constructor.

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        total_params = sum([p.size for n,p in utils.tree_flatten(self.parameters())])

          ctx = mx.concatenate((ctx, next_tok), axis=1)
        return ctx
    def _init_parameters(self):
        normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)
        residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 / math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))
        new_params = []
        for name, module in self.named_modules():
            if isinstance(module, nn.layers.linear.Linear):
                if 'c_proj' in name:
                    new_params.append((name + '.weight', residual_init(module.weight)))
                else:
                    new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))
                if 'bias' in module:
                    new_params.append((name + '.bias', mx.zeros(module.bias.shape)))
            elif isinstance(module, nn.layers.embedding.Embedding):
                new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))
        self = self.update(utils.tree_unflatten(new_params))

We also add 2 lines of code in the constructor to print the total number of params. Finally, we are ready to build the training loop.

Training Loop
To train the model we need a loss function. Since we are predicting classes (next token) we use cross-entropy loss.

def loss_fn(model, x, y):
    logits = model(x)
    B, T, C = logits.shape # (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size)
    logits = logits.reshape(B*T, C)
    y = y.reshape(B*T)
    loss = nn.losses.cross_entropy(logits, y, reduction='mean')
    return loss
First, we get the logits from the model. Then we reshape logits to make a list of vocab_size length arrays. We also reshape y, the correct token ids, to have the same length. Then we use the built-in cross-entropy loss function to calculate the loss for each example and average them to get a single value.

model = GPT()
mx.eval(model.parameters()) # Create the model params (mlx is lazy evaluation)
loss_and_grad = nn.value_and_grad(model, loss_fn)
lr = 0.1
optimizer = optim.AdamW(learning_rate=lr)
Next, we instantiate the model, but since mlx is lazy evaluation it won’t allocate and create the parameters. We need to call mx.eval on the parameters to ensure they get created. Then we can use nn.value_and_grad() to get a function that returns the loss and gradient of model parameters w.r.t the loss. This is all we need to optimize. Finally, we initialize an AdamW optimizer.

A quick note on nn.value_and_grad(). If you are used to PyTorch you might expect us to use loss.backward() which goes through the computation graph and updates the .grad attribute of each tensor in our model. However, mlx automatic differentiation works on functions instead of computation graphs [3]. Therefore, mlx has built-ins that take in a function and return the gradient function such as nn.value_and_grad() .

Now we define the training loop.

num_epochs=20
batch_size=32
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train(True)
    running_loss = 0
    batch_cnt = 0
    for input, label in get_batches(X_train, y_train, batch_size):
        batch_cnt += 1
        loss, grads = loss_and_grad(model, input, label)
        optimizer.update(model, grads)
        running_loss += loss.item()
        # compute new parameters and optimizer state
        mx.eval(model.parameters(), optimizer.state)
    avg_train_loss = running_loss / batch_cnt
    model.train(False) # set eval mode
    running_loss = 0
    batch_cnt = 0
    for input, label in get_batches(X_val, y_val, batch_size):
        batch_cnt += 1
        loss = loss_fn(model, input, label)
        running_loss += loss.item()
    avg_val_loss = running_loss / batch_cnt
    print(f""Epoch {epoch:2} | train = {avg_train_loss:.4f} | val = {avg_val_loss:.4f}"")
The outer loop runs through the epochs. We first set the model to training mode because some modules have different behaviors during training and testing such as dropout. Then we use our get_batches function from earlier to loop through batches of the training data. We get the loss over the batch and the gradient using loss_and_grad . Then we pass the model and gradients to the optimizer to update the model parameters. Finally we call mx.eval (remember mlx does lazy evaluation) to ensure the parameters and optimizer state get updated. Then we calculate the average train loss over the data to print later. This is one pass through the training data. Similarly, we calculate the validation loss and then print the average train and val loss over the epoch.

completion = decode(model.generate(1000)[0].tolist())
print(completion)
with open('completions.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(completion)
Finally, we add some code to generate from our model. Since the generation output is still in the (B, T) shape we have to index it at 0 to make it 1D and then convert it from an mlx array to a Python list. Then we can pass it to our decode function from earlier, and write it to a file.

These are the parameters we will use for training (you can play around with this):

ctx_len = 128
n_emb = 128
dropout = 0.1
head_size = 128
n_heads = 4
n_layers = 3
num_epochs = 20
batch_size = 64
lr = 1e-3
Now we can run the file to start training. With the settings above training took around 10 minutes on my m2 MacBook. I achieved the following training loss last epoch.

Epoch 19 | train = 1.6961 | val = 1.8143
Let’s look at some output.

Not bad for just 10 minutes of training with a tiny model that is predicting characters! It clearly has the form of Shakespeare, although it is nonsense. The only difference between our model and the real GPT-2 now is scale! Now I encourage you to experiment — try out different settings, maybe tinker with the architecture, and see how low of a loss you can achieve.

14,"My eyes felt like galaxies—holding the swirling glow of countless memories—as I took in our childhood home. Its siding looked like remnants of driftwood after a bonfire. I swore I smelled the smoky char of pine creep into my nostrils. It’s wild how the past stays with you like that. It can feel more visceral and real than the tangible things right in front of you.

“Jesus, it feels like just yesterday.” I placed a trembling hand over my heart, struggling to steady my breath.

My brother, Perry, pulled me into a tight embrace, his strength grounding me like an anchor.

“The house hasn’t changed much,” he said, his voice steady and comforting. “But we have.” His certainty made me question, Have I really changed?

Between the two of us, Perry was as solid and stoic as a mountain range. Good thing, because I was like the wind—flighty and unpredictable. Over the years, Perry had learned to handle even my harshest hurricanes.

Being his older sister—even if only by four minutes—I always wished I’d been his protector rather than the other way around. But that demon burning deep in my belly also flashed a crooked smile, knowing that Perry would never abandon me, especially since I got sober.

I hadn’t had a drink in exactly seven hundred and thirty days, and although it remained unsaid, I knew Perry was terrified of leaving me to my own devices in fear I would relapse.

Our sibling bond was iron-clad. After we lost our parents in the fire (my mother didn’t properly butt out her 2:00 am cigarette and well, the rest is history), all Perry and I had was each other. But let’s call a spade a spade; we were also as fucked up and as co-dependent as it gets. Who mutually decides to visit the catalyst of your alcohol addiction on the anniversary of your sobriety?

The house’s dilapidated front door creaked as Perry gently pushed it open. The rusted metal hinges were holding it up by a thread.

“After you.” Perry gestured me in, squinting from the sunlight. He was a gentleman, even in such obscurity.

As he held the door open, the shallow scar on his right cheek taunted me like some kind of schoolyard bully. His wound often pulled me in like that. Some days, I was sure I would dive right into it and drown. Other days, I prayed to God and the Devil himself to just let me fucking drown, already.

That mark became permanently etched on Perry’s face on the day I quit drinking, exactly seven hundred and thirty days ago. That was the day Perry screamed bloody murder at me from the passenger seat, “Jackie! Stop the fucking car!” But my bloodstream was far too poisoned with Bacardi Limon to listen. All I remember next was my vehicle being wrapped around a tree. I could have died that day, but what truly disturbed me in the middle of the night was the fact that I almost killed Perry.

A lot can happen in seven hundred and thirty days. But I assure you, forgiving yourself isn’t one of them.

“Well? You coming in?” Perry was still holding the door ajar.

I shook it off and gave my brother a knowing glance. I swear, even though we were fraternal, we had twin telepathy. I exhaled and walked in.

“Watch your step,” I warned, my forehead tense.

I imagined the rickety floorboards collapsing, crashing us into what had once been our dad’s “man cave”. That’s where he was passed out, the night of the fire.

“Kids, stay here. Do not move,” our mother demanded after getting us out of the house safely. I remember the black soot on her face and the spiderweb veins in her eyes. She shook us firmly by the forearms. “I’m getting your father.”

Perry and I held each other, shaking. The heat from the inferno felt like standing in a volcano. We never saw our parents again.

Two decades later, there we were—Perry and I—-making our way through the wreckage of our home. It was midday, yet the inside of the house screamed a tone of pale blue midnight. My shoulders were up to my ears, as though we were walking through a haunted house attraction.

I coughed into my forearm. The ocean of dust was thick like butter. As I cleared my lungs, Perry called out from behind me.

“Jacks, look at this! The fireplace,” Perry's voice was filled with awe.

“Unbelievable. It’s still here,” I whispered, a lump forming in my throat.

It was as though a Fairy Godmother breezed by and brought the decaying living room to life with her magical paintbrush. Kind of like in “Titanic”, when they showed the sunken ship underwater, versus in its prestige as it sailed across the Atlantic.

We made our way over to the fireplace and sat cross-legged on the floor.

“This was our favorite spot, remember?” I avoided his gaze, overwhelmed by the flood of memories.

“Yeah,” Perry murmured, his eyes softening with nostalgia.

For a moment, the taste of crispy, fire roasted marshmallows superseded the saturated stench of mildew.

“Remember our s’mores nights?” I asked.

“Duh. What about all our fireplace movie nights?” Perry proceeded to do his best, nasally, childhood impersonation of me, “But mom! I want to watch Beauty and the Beast!! Perry always gets to pick the movie!!”

I punched him in the arm, “First of all, I never sounded like that. And second. So what? I knew what I wanted.”

The corners of Perry’s mouth lifted. He had such a sincere sparkle about him, as though a storm cloud of confetti followed him overhead wherever he went, “You really did, kiddo.”

My chest went heavy. How could Perry love me after everything I had done? After all the relationships I’d ruined? All the jobs I’d lost? All of his relationships I’d ruined? How could he still choose me, when so often I had chosen a forty of Jack Daniels over him?

How could Perry still love me after I almost fucking killed him?

Perry’s gaze widened, “Hey! Remember when Mom would bring out those hot drinks she always made?” He paused, almost as if he was searching for the right term. “Apple… something? Apple ssshhh…”

I snapped my fingers, “Apple-Schnapple!”

“Yes!”

“I mean, looking back it was basically just hot apple cider, but damn it was good.” And it really was.

Our laughs echoed throughout the abandoned asylum we once called home.

Perry leaned back, holding himself up with his hands. “I loved our fireplace hangs. Especially our movie nights down here. But nothing beats our movies up in the projector room.”

I tilted my head, “We never had a projector room.”

Perry playfully “shoo’d” me away.

“No. Perry. I would remember us having a projector room. Our movie nights together were our favorite thing. You even just said it yourself.”

The house suddenly became pin-drop silent as Perry leaned in. ""Memories are quite something, aren’t they?"" The slight shift in his tone made my skin crawl. Perry was always wistful, but this felt different, almost… clinical, ""We often remember things in ways that are… easier for us to digest.""

I was fidgety. “Gees Perry. You sound like Dr. Lasko.”

He seemed to enjoy my little joke.

Dr. Lasko had been my therapist since the accident, and I would go out on a limb and say that he would not have approved of this self-inflicted exposure therapy I was subjecting myself to by visiting the house.

Perry seemingly snapped out of his little therapist moment and went right back to being his sparkly confetti self. As I watched his amicable face scan the mantle above the fireplace, I felt a sickening uneasiness. Imagine you had actually fucking killed him.

“Man, I can still picture all our family photos up there,” Perry’s childlike wonder destroyed me.

My face went flush. I could feel the water rising in my eyes like the tides. How pathetic and infuriating was it that after everything I’d done, I was still somehow the victim.

“Hey.” He took my hand.

“Oh Perry,”  I threw myself into him. “I’m so sorry.”

My brother held me with his usual care that I didn’t deserve.

“Jacks, it’s ok. I’m still here. We’re both still here.”

As my chin rested on my brother’s shoulder, I looked ahead of me at the remains of the house. Something felt off, and it wasn’t just the overall unsettling environment. My brow furrowed. “Wasn’t the doorway to the kitchen on the other side of the living room?”

I felt Perry shrug, “I don’t think so.”

I was staring into the out of place doorway like I was trying to pull a recollection towards me. And that’s when I saw them in the kitchen: the translucent memory of mom and dad. Mom was getting our Apple-Schnapples ready. She was pacing, unlike Dad, who was sitting motionless at the table. His face was planted on its mahogany surface. His glass of Apple-Schnapple was empty, and so was the bottle of Jim Beam beside it.

Mom floated into the living room, our warm beverages in hand and a cigarette in her mouth, “Kids, your father’s not feeling well. Let’s have our Apple-Schnapples in here.”

Oh my God. The bruise on her face.

Perry jarred me back to reality with the gut punch of what he had to say next, “You’re remembering the truth about mom and dad, aren’t you?”

I pushed myself off and away from him. “How did you…”

My brother looked down, delicately tracing the floor with his finger, “We always put them on a pedestal after they died.”

I felt a shiver run down my spine, “What are you talking about?”

As Perry continued to speak, his words grew even more detached. ""Do you remember that first drink Dad ever gave you?""

My eyes darted around the room as my jugular pulsed in my neck. As much as I tried to escape what Perry had just said, I did remember.

I could hear my dad’s slurring words of encouragement, “Come on, Jackie. Just one drink. It’ll be our special time, just you and me.”

The bitterness of that first sip of beer made me squirm, but sharing a “special time” with my dad—and the desperate yearning that maybe he did love me, afterall—was the overwhelm of the full moon swallowing me whole. I was only a child, and much like how my mom turned a blind eye to my father’s drinking, she did the exact same when it came to her daughter.

I’d used the death of my parents as the excuse for my alcoholism for so long, because admitting that they helped create the monster I would eventually become was like a knife to the heart. And knowing I had been too weak to conquer the addiction from my own volition just made the weapon twist in my chest.

The room was spinning. My face was blistering hot like the night of the fire. Or was that the warm heat from the fireplace when we were kids? The childhood fireplace memories ran through my mind, frame by frame, until…..they eventually vaporized to nothing. I crouched over, thinking I might vomit.

“We never had a fireplace.” Perry was nodding, very matter-of-factly.

My fingernails dug into my thighs when I looked at the fireplace and: it was gone. Only a blank wall of faded, forest green wallpaper remained. Our house was once on fire, yes, but that was it. There was never a happy childhood fireplace. Ever.

My hands were cold and clammy. I fell back onto the wall behind me. “Perry. Where are we?”

He stood up and glided towards the staircase. One hand on the banister, his footsteps creaked, one by one, as he made his way to the second floor.

My mouth was bone dry, “Perry!”

He stopped and turned towards me, “Come to the projector room. We love watching movies together, don’t we? There’s a movie I’d like to show you.”

As my brother disappeared from sight, I did what any classic horror movie trope would tell you to do: I went upstairs.

I found Perry standing at the end of the ominous hallway. Large, empty picture frames lined the oxblood walls leading up to him. Through the doorway where Perry stood, particles in the air danced in the projector’s cone-shaped light. That telltale winding of a film reel was the only sound in the deafening quiet of this house that I no longer recognized.

Half of Perry’s face—the one with the scar—was perfectly illuminated, as though he was wearing the mask from “The Phantom of the Opera”. “I think you’re ready to see how this movie ends, Jackie. This is the most progress you’ve made since we’ve been coming here.”

I gripped my thumbs in the palms of my hands, “Perry, you’re freaking the fuck out of me!”

I thought my knees might buckle as my brother’s face glitched, like a flash of static snow on a television set. As his face settled back to normal to a deadpan gaze, he disappeared in the innocuous room. I followed, running on nothing but fumes.

Clutching the doorway, my mouth fell agape. Perry was gone. I darted to the middle of the room.

As I frantically searched for my brother, I shielded my eyes with the back of my hand from the projector’s light. And that’s when, from behind me, I heard five words that made my blood run cold, “Jackie! Stop the fucking car!”

I was convulsing yet paralyzed. Moving as slowly as cold molasses, I rotated on the spot towards my worst nightmare, shown on 35 mm. On the projector screen was Perry and me in my car, exactly seven hundred and thirty days ago, the day I almost kill—

Oh my God.

My head pounded as fragmented memories surged. The reality of what happened began to crystallize, unrelenting.

My joints ached and my stomach churned. Clamping a hand over my mouth to stifle a scream, I stumbled down the hallway as it began caving in on itself. The picture frames were sucked into the walls. The floorboards cracked into distorted peaks and valleys. Wooden beams swung down from the ceiling like pendulums. I tried to spit out the chalky grit of disintegrating drywall that made the hallway look like a winter squall.

Panting heavily, I stopped dead in my tracks at the stained glass window. My body trembled with an all-too-familiar dread. Each time I faced this, I wondered if this fall would be the one that would finally end it all.

Maybe it’d be better if it did.

Holding my breath, I threw myself through the glass, my hands clawing the air for dear life. Free falling two stories feels like an eternity when you’re watching the memory of your childhood home fall apart before your very eyes. But when the weight of my body finally made contact with the earth I—

I gasped. The cold air of the hospital room shocked my lungs. I sat up, ripping the suction cups from my face and body. My gown was clinging to me, soaked in sweat. Medical equipment beeped all around me like a metronome.

Dr. Lasko, my therapist since the accident, sat across the stark white room, sighing as he rubbed his forehead. He, too, was connected to a plethora of suction cups and wires. He looked a little worn out in the fluorescent overhead lighting. Ever since I was hospitalized and later incarcerated, Dr. Lasko had been helping me delve into my memories, namely the ones that were too excruciating for me to face. And as such, Dr. Lasko had been appearing in the simulations as my brother Perry, the love of my life who died in the car crash, seven hundred and thirty days prior.

Disoriented, I blinked rapidly, the vividness of the memory contrasting sharply with the sterile, geometric ceiling tiles above me.

“I don’t ever want to do that again!” I was venomous.

“Jackie,” Dr. Lasko started.

“Don’t start,” I pulled up four fingers for air quotes, “‘Jackie, don’t give up. This was the closest you’ve ever come to facing the truth.”

As the initial burst of adrenal and cortisol left my body, I fell back on my pillow. I was depleted. Quiet rivers flowed down my cheeks.

Removing his own suction cups, Dr. Lasko approached my bedside and took a seat. He treaded lightly. “Jackie, I understand how challenging this is for you, but you did an incredible job today. If we continue making progress like this, there's a real possibility you'll gain your freedom sooner.”

I looked at the well-meaning doctor, but all I could see was Perry. Multicolored confetti fell softly around him like that first November snow. His face was the sun. His eyes reflected the whole world back to me.

Perry.

With a weak grip, I took Dr. Lasko’s hand. My vocal cords were like sandpaper. “I’ll leave this place one day, doc.” A single tear dripped from my chin onto my collarbone. “But I’m not sure if I’ll ever be free.”

Dr. Lasko didn’t say a word, but I felt him squeeze my hand, just a little bit tighter.

I licked the cracks on my lips as my eyes closed shut, imagining the oaky comfort of bourbon on my tongue. I felt myself drift, and good thing, because I needed the rest. Dr. Lasko and I would be delving into my memories again the following day.

No matter how masochistic it felt, I vowed to keep showing up for the simulations. Even if I never forgave myself for what I did, at least in my memories, I got to see Perry.",What references to alcohol are there,"The narrator, Jackie, had been sober for seven hundred and thirty days. Seven hundred and thirty days ago, Jackie and Perry had gotten into a car accident that almost killed the two because Jackie had been driving after drinking Bacardi Limon.

Jackie saw a translucent memmory of her dad sitting motionless at a table with an empty glass of Apple-Schnapple and an empty bottle of Jim Beam. Jackie also remembered he father giving her beer as a child and her mother ignoring this.

She used the death of her parents as an excuse for her alcoholism for so long, because admitting that they helped create the monster she would eventually become was like a knife to the heart. And knowing she had been too weak to conquer the addiction from her own volition just made the weapon twist in her chest.

Finally, at the end of the story, Jackie licked the cracks on her lips as her eyes closed shut, imagining the oaky comfort of bourbon on her tongue. She felt herself drift, which she thought a good thing, because she needed the rest.","Jackie has been sober for 730 days after a car accident caused by her drinking Bacardi Limon, in which Perry was almost killed. Jackie recalls her father with an empty bottle of Jim Beam and herself first tasting beer as a child. Her parents' death was used as an excuse for her alcoholism despite their role in her addiction. Finally, she imagines the taste of bourbon as she drifts to sleep, needing rest.","Jackie was sober for two years but still struggles with alcohol cravings, specifically Bacardi Limon. Her father was a heavy drinker, often passing out with a bottle of whiskey. Her addiction began during childhood with her parents contributing to her drinking habits. In her memories, her brother Perry frequently drank with her, which she now wishes to change."
8,"so into northern spain!
our magical urban-plus-outdoor-adventure itinerary
CAROLINE CHAMBERS
MAY 29, 2024

I recently returned from a trip to Northern Spain with two of my best friends, Lily and Nellie, sponsored by elsewhere, a travel company that works with local experts to create truly unique travel experiences.

On our last day in Spain, we had an incredible private tour of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and then partook in our favorite trip ritual: hopping around from pintxo bar to pintxo bar (pintxos = small little plates of food — similar to tapas but they are typically sitting on the bar and you point to what you want), drinking txakoli (a lightly effervescent white wine that is very, very popular in the region), and playing gin rummy.

We then headed back to our hotel room, crammed onto the bed with, well, another bottle of txakoli, and recorded what I can only assume was the greatest podcast episode of all time. We recapped the full trip, what we loved, what we would change. We shared the most absurd moments. We laughed so hard and made so much fun of each other in a way that only really old friends who have just spent 12 days straight together can do. I’ve been so excited to share it.

But… the recording failed. I have no idea what happened, but I blame the txakoli.

I thought about re-recording with them remotely, but the magic of that moment, being there together on the last night of a truly perfect trip, is gone. So instead, I’ll share the highlights here! Full itinerary with ALL the details is here.


We spent two nights in Madrid and could have spent at least four. There’s so much to see and do here, and we barely scratched the surface. Our highlights were shopping in the Chueca and Salamanca neighborhoods — Malababa, Soeur, and Sessùn were some of our favorite shops. We had a wonderful meal at Charrúa Madrid and fun cocktails at Ficus Bar. You can find all of our favorite shops, tapas bars, and many places that we didn’t get to explore but wanted to on my Spain map here.


strolling the charming, windy streets of chueca!

San Sebastián is the coolest town — worth a trip to Spain all on its own. It’s a coastal town on the Northern coast of Spain, right next to the French border, and it fully charmed us. It’s that perfect European blend of old meets new — hip young surfers going to 200-year-old pintxo bars to meet up with their friends after surfing all afternoon, 100-year-old pastry shops next door to chic Spanish design ateliers. We spent three nights there and loved every minute, but these were our highlights:

cooking in a private gastronomic club
When you’re wandering the cobblestone streets of San Sebastián looking for your next pintxo, you might find yourself stumbling through the doorway of a friendly looking restaurant, only to be turned away. “Disculpa, privado!” they’ll tell you — “Sorry, private!”

You’ve stumbled into a sociedad gastronómica — one of San Sebastián’s 100+ private gastronomic clubs. Each one has its own personality and offering, but at its core is this: it’s a private social club centered around cooking and eating with fellow members. Members reserve a time to cook — depending on the size of the club, three to four members can cook at a time — and they can invite guests to join them. Members will head to one of the many local markets, grab their food, and then bring it back to the shared kitchen to cook for/with their friends and family.


post-lunch txakoli on the deck at the club
The only hitch? You have to be with a member to go inside of one! This was the coolest tour that elsewhere set up for us — Jani, our guide, was an incredibly cool young mom and entrepreneur (she owns her own tour company) and is a member of several clubs. She picked us up at our hotel, took us to her favorite local market and farmer’s market to grab ingredients, and then back to her club, which was a stone building with wooden beams and felt like a scene out of a Game of Thrones banquet. We cooked a local fish dish, a tomato salad, and seared white asparagus, and she taught us all about Basque cuisine and the local gastronomic clubs.

We spent the entire afternoon cooking and eating and drinking txakoli on the deck of her club overlooking the city. A cannot miss experience if you find yourself in San Seb! Here’s a great Saveur article if you want to read more about the clubs.

pintxo hopping
Pick three or four pintxos bars that are close together, and hop from bar to bar, eating a snack and having a glass of txakoli at each one. This is always my favorite way to explore a new place on limited time — an appetizer at one spot, a meal at another, after-dinner drinks at a third, so the pintxos culture really allows you to see a lot of places in one night!

My map has a lot of great pintxos bars saved, but here’s an especially great hop (these are all on my map):

Start at Ganbara and grab whatever looks good — we had delightful fried padrón peppers.

Walk over to Txepetxa Taberna for a little sandwich — my favorites were the simple ones filled with local jámon and idiazábal cheese (similar to manchego).

The cheesy risotto at Borda Berri was phenomenal.

Finish your night at Otaegui, the oldest bakery in the city, for pantxineta, a delightful puff pastry and custard-filled local treat, and a slice of Basque cheesecake.


pintxo hopping around the old town!
surfing
Nellie is a big surfer and after a full 24 hours of pestering, finally convinced me to go out with her. There are tons of surf shops that rent wetsuits and boards lining the beach, so it was really easy to get into the water. The waves were absolutely perfect. Gentle, clear water, no getting-stuck-in-a-washing-machine vibes when you fall of your board. It was so, so much fun.



My favorite part of the trip was our four days on the camino. The Camino de Santiago, also known as the Way of Saint James, is a well-trod pilgrimage route that traverses Spain, culminating at the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. The camino has origins back to the medieval era and has four routes connecting different parts of Spain to Galicia. The routes consist of trails, modern roads, and original medieval stone pathways…


that pass through everything from modern city to medieval village…


to small fishing town…


to stunning wilderness landscapes.


The flysch was truly breathtaking. If you wind up in San Sabastián and want to walk just one day of the camino, walk from Orio to Zumaia, all the way out past the town to see the flysch, then sleep at Hotel Iturregi that night!
The Camino Francés is the most popular route, but my friends and I did a small portion of the Camino Norte, which San Sebastián is right on. The Norte is challenging and stunningly beautiful, with steep, rugged terrain, but with plenty of stopping places for pintxos and a glass of wine along the way. It’s hard to sum up what a wonderful experience hiking it was.

We originally wanted to hike directly from one location to the next — to hike from one hotel to the next without ever getting in a car — 15 to 20 miles per day on the camino. However, the hotels along the route are rustic, more rustic than we were up for, so we wound up switching to stay at a gorgeous hotel in a txakoli vineyard, and just took cabs to and from the camino for our last two days.

Hiking the camino was a bucket list experience — we hiked through fishing villages and past a truly breathtaking flysch rock formation, a cult tried to recruit us by beckoning us in with warm tea and cake, we talked about everything, we talked about nothing, we laughed so hard it hurt. I cannot wait to get back to the camino one day.


Bilbao was an excellent urban re-introduction at the end of four days on the camino. We really didn’t know what to expect, and we were pleasantly surprised. I wouldn’t make a trip to Spain specifically for Bilbao, but I’d certainly make an effort to visit if I was in Northern Spain.

The Guggenheim alone could occupy an entire day — it’s a massive collection of modern and contemporary art. The architecture itself is reason alone to visit. We loved touring the museum with a private tour guide who regaled us with detailed information about every single piece.


We strolled along the river from the Guggenheim all the way to the seven streets area, where we bopped between shops and pintxo bars for the rest of the day. Admittedly, we enjoyed a lot of Italian food in Bilbao as we were feeling a little burnt out on Basque food by this point in the trip. No shame in dabbling in a little pizza while in Spain! You’ll find lots of Basque and Italian recs on my map!

After two nights in Bilbao, we headed home. It was a truly magical trip that we’ll still be laughing and reminiscing about when we’re old ladies.



I love electrolyte powders but so many brands have a lot of sodium in them, which can make me feel really bloated. Ultima is lower-sodium and the flavors are great!

Lily had a lanyard strap iPhone case that I was really jealous of. Kind of dorky looking but who cares, it was so convenient to have her phone handy for photos and looking up directions!

I will never stop yappin’ about my Owala water bottle. Having the ability to drink out of the straw or tilt it and chug it never gets old!

I brought disposable cameras for each of us and I can’t wait to get the film back!! Mattis saw them and has been begging me to get him one — it would be fun to give your kids a disposable camera to capture a summer trip!



Pan-fried dover sole with buttery tomato sauce and corn risotto. The reviews on this week’s recipe are RAVING! It really is so good and fancy feeling. You have to make this one ASAP, especially if you travel somewhere with access to great fish this summer!

Sunshine curry was a cult fave last summer — of yours and of mine! I love making a huge batch and eating it for lunch all week long (a perk of the fact that my kids won’t touch it, though I know many kids love this one!).

My summer tomato galette is the stuff of summer produce dreams. Buy a store-bought pie crust to make it even easier, but it’s worth making the crust from scratch if you have 15 extra minutes! PS: Make the boursin summer squash galette while you’re at it. Two summery galettes + a simple salad of romaine tossed with salt, pepper, really good extra-virgin olive oil, and balsamic, with shaved Parm, and chopped almonds would be such a chic little meal.

Chicken panzanella is one of my all-time faves. Crisp croutons, juicy tomatoes, perfectly cooked chicken, balsamic, olive oil, basil, with big hunks of melty goat cheese. It’s the perfect summer lunch or dinner! Don’t let your croutons burn!


I loved reading about all of your happy places in the comments of last week’s post! My number one takeaway is that I need to spend more time in Maine — so many of your happy places are there! Including this week’s winner, Heather.


Dreamy! And now you can bring your new pair of Lake Pajamas to Boothbay Harbor this summer! Email me your size and address!

Do you have any Spain recs to add? Anyone taking an exciting trip this summer? We’re staying local for most of the summer so that we can enjoy our new cabin, minus our annual two-week Southern voyage to DeBordieu, SC to visit George’s family and Bald Head Island, NC to visit mine!",Where was I offered desserts?,"You ate a delightful puff pastry and custard-filled local treat, and a slice of Basque cheesecake at Otaegui, and you were beckoned with cake in the camino.",You enjoyed pantxineta and Basque cheesecake at Otaegui and were offered cake on the Camino.,You were treated to a chocolate mousse and churros at the Guggenheim.
1,"---The Paths through the Underground/Underdark---(9 days of travel)
Wandering through the dark tunnels, the rushing sounds of the underground river begin to fade as it diverges from the cavern. You walk on for miles, the smell of hard water and wet earth. Natural chambers and cavern passways are chained together by the stretches of burrowed earth left in the wake of this massive worm-like creature. Clusters of crystal and other beautiful minerals occasionally line the walls and ceilings of the chambers, glittering with the little light you have to shove back the darkness.

Day 1 goes without issue... sleep.

Day 2 – Ropers
After a few miles of winding tunnel, you emerge in a smaller grotto of stalactites and stalagmites dripping with condensation. Unsure if the same underground river, or another water source, is nearby, you can see quite a bit of ground water does funnel down into this area. Seeking the next burrowed entrance left by the Kryn...
---ENCOUNTER – Ropers x 2---
Day 3 goes without issue...sleep.

Day 4 - Kobold Trap
Part way into the journey, the path becomes a protracted tunnel, snaking through the rock for hours without end. Eventually, you begin to notice other smaller tunnels intersecting with the burrowed canal. They appear partially ruined by this fresher tunnel, many of them now filled or partially collapsed.

They are no more than 2-3 feet wide, and numerous (dozens).

In some of the rubble, you can find broken tools... a hammer, some soiled leather, a knife.

The tunnel finally seems to open into a small 15-foot high, 30ft long chamber of dirt and rock, where a rather rancid smell lingers. Glancing within, a handful of the smaller tunnels seem to intersect with it, and whomever enters first (if not Cad), their leg is SNARED by a noose and they must make a Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 15) or be lifted into the air to dangle from a small trap (restrained, DC 16 to escape). The snare also drags a cable tied to numerous pans and metal scraps, making a ruckus!

Chattering and tiny warcrys begin to fill the tunnel from all sides... as dozens of small kobolds rush into the room, and from behind!

-ENCOUNTER: Kobolds x 26, Kobold Inventor x 1-
“Loud food! Loud meal!”

When seeing the group, they bark and growl. (if noticed, they appear rather fearful)

“You! Give us stuffs! Give us foods! Drop things you have, or we stab stab!”

If asked about tunnel “Big worm eat through! Bring ingoeth! In and out, gone quick, leave mess!”

They must parlay with them, avoiding a battle with a significant trade, or intimidation. Otherwise, a fight ensues! Either way, two kobolds are too scared and freeze up. They are brothers Spurt and Bex, scavenger kobolds. They are timid, but know the tunnels well...ish?",What enemies are encountered in the second encounter?,26 kobolds and 1 kobold inventor are encountered in the second encounter.,You face 26 kobolds and a kobold inventor in the second encounter.,"In the second encounter, you face a small group of wandering Ropers."

Emily can be married and has new dialogue, scheduling and heart events.
Buildings
Robin has a few new buildings available for sale.
shed: an empty room which players can do whatever they like with. They can decorate it the same way as their house.
mill: lets players place wheat in it to make flour, or beets to make sugar. One wheat makes one flour. One beet makes 3 sugars. When they place wheat or beets inside, the flour or sugar will be ready the next morning. The little box on the right side of the mill acts like a chest and it will contain any product that has been milled the previous day.
The wizard now offers new farm buildings after completing a quest line. These buildings are very expensive and intended for end-game. They'll appear instantly after purchase, unlike Robin's buildings which require construction.
Junimo hut: Junimos will come out to harvest any mature crops within a certain distance of the hut. The Junimos will place the crops they harvest in the hut for players to grab at their leisure.
Water obelisk: when interacted with, it warps players to the beach, exactly like the beach warp totem. It's basically an infinite totem that lives on the farm.
Earth obelisk: just like the water obelisk except it warps players to the mountains.
Gold clock: prevents debris from appearing on your farm. Keeps fences from decaying.
Farm maps
There are now five farm maps to choose from when starting a new game. The basic map that exists currently, as well as a new map themed around each ""skill"". Each special map has a feature that makes it a little different, and each map also comes with unique decorations inside the players house.
Riverlands: lots of water on this map... limiting your farm space. Looks nice. Fishing is actually viable on this farm... In fact, players can catch the same fish that are available in town.
Forest: the forest encroaches on the land, limiting farming space. However, there are renewable stumps on the east edge of the map, and seasonal forage items spawn there as well. Also, there is a new type of ""weed"" that spawns on the farm, which looks unique and will always drop mixed seeds when cut.
Hill-top: lots of cliffs... and there is a special mining area in the southwest where ore will spawn, as well as unique geode-bearing stones.
Wilderness: lots of space to farm, looks a little more interesting than the basic farm with a large lake in the southwest corner, and a cliff along the east and south. On this map, bats and golems will come out at night. There is a new monster called a wilderness golem which is unique to this map. It behaves just like the stone golem, but has different drops. Its stats scale with player combat level.
