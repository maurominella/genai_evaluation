See our ethics statement.\n\nIt\u2019s been another banner year for science fiction and fantasy books. Many of our favorites once again blur the line between sci-fi and fantasy, but this year was a particular standout for books blurring the line between SFF and other genres. This includes everything from historical fiction \u2014 both speculative histories and Westerns \u2014 to fable retellings to intergenerational sagas in translation.\n\nThough we seem to have crested the wave of pandemic novels, that sense of dread and discoloration has lingered, written into novels of new forms. There\u2019s a preponderance of post-post-apocalyptic science fiction unpacking lofty ideas like sentience and humanity, often set on different planets or among the stars. It has also been a standout year for supernatural horrors and thrillers, particularly ones that mix queer longing with a dose of body horror. Last but not least, it\u2019s been a great year for kissing books set in fantastical worlds.\n\nRELATED\n\nLooking for more recs? Here are our favorite books of 2022\nSo jump in and take your pick. Whichever direction you head in, it will be sure to grip you \u2014 and make you think. This list is in reverse chronological order, so the newest releases are listed first. We updated this list throughout 2023, sometimes retroactively adding in entries that we missed from earlier in the year. We\u2019ve also included our favorite runners-up.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS\nEmily Wilde\u2019s Encyclopaedia of Faeries by Heather Fawcett, Victory City by Salman Rushdie, The Crane Husband by Kelly Barnhill, The Mimicking of Known Successes by Malka Older, Monstrilio by Gerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova, White Cat, Black Dog by Kelly Link, Divine Rivals by Rebecca Ross, Our Hideous Progeny by C.E.

Pacat\n\nCover image for Ed Park\u2019s Same Bed Different Dreams, a split image between what looks like Earth and Mars.\nImage: Random House\nSAME BED DIFFERENT DREAMS BY ED PARK\nSame Bed Different Dreams is a remarkable achievement, and not for the faint of heart. Through three storylines, the book creates a kind of speculative history of Korea, with an emphasis on World War II and Japan\u2019s colonial rule and aftermath (and, crucially, the United States\u2019 involvement). One story thread builds out a hefty alternative history of the Korean Provisional Government\u2019s role and reach. Another story thread focuses on a Black Korean War vet who wrote a sci-fi epic series called 2333, which is later adapted into a video game. And yet another story thread has a more futuristic flavor, focusing on a has-been writer who now works for a tech company called GLOAT. These threads periodically intersect \u2014 for example, GLOAT ends up owning the rights to 2333, and turns it into a kind of edutainment.\n\nIf it sounds like there\u2019s a lot going on, it\u2019s because there is. And it\u2019s made even denser by the author\u2019s Pynchonian sense of humor. Some of its best moments are utterly weird or feel like the writer was smirking \u2014 like a character\u2019s dog who can\u2019t stop \u201carchiving\u201d by burying found manuscript pages, the fact that GLOAT employees truly don\u2019t know what the acronym stands for, or the idea that Marilyn Monroe is a member of the Korean Provisional Government. These absurd bits only make it harder to comb apart what\u2019s real and what\u2019s Ed Park\u2019s \u201calternate history\u201d in sections with realistic-sounding combinations of fact and fiction.\n\nIt\u2019s got the same ambitious patchwork as Jennifer Egan\u2019s The Candy House and Namwali Serpell\u2019s The Old Drift. Critics have compared it to everything from David Mitchell\u2019s Cloud Atlas to David Foster Wallace\u2019s Infinite Jest. There\u2019s also, of course, books within the book. It\u2019s a fever dream of a thing, and one I\u2019d heartily recommend, but perhaps with a notebook in hand or some sticky notes to help track the references. (Or perhaps, as I did, just letting the wave of information roll over you, until you\u2019re left with a vast impression and a desire to reread.) \u2014Nicole Clark\n\nCover image for Kylie Lee Baker\u2019s The Scarlet Alchemist, featuring a woman in a red outfit with a large crown set against a dark skyline.\nImage: Inkyard Press\nTHE SCARLET ALCHEMIST (THE SCARLET ALCHEMIST #1) BY KYLIE LEE BAKER\nDo not go into The Scarlet Alchemist expecting typical YA fare. What Kylie Lee Baker delivers is a story of visceral brutality, interlaced with elements of Chinese history and thoughtful meditations on family, race, and belonging. It\u2019s a book that can turn your stomach as easily as it can break your heart.\n\nSet in an alternate Tang dynasty, the novel follows Zilan, a profoundly talented young alchemist who travels to the capital in hopes of landing a coveted position in the royal service. But being a poor, half Scotian girl means the odds are stacked inordinately high against her in the imperial service exams \u2014 and that\u2019s before her skills with the illegal art of resurrection catch the prince\u2019s attention and pull her into a dangerous political game. While the premise seems familiar (underdog competes in trials, falls into star-crossed romance), Baker\u2019s skills with immersive world-building, knotty characters, and genuinely gruesome horror make The Scarlet Alchemist a dazzling and singular tale that left me rushing to read her back catalog. \u2014Sadie Gennis\n\nCover image of C Pam Zhang\u2019s Land of Milk and Honey, featuring rollicking hills of white, blue, and yellow.\nImage: Riverhead\nLAND OF MILK AND HONEY BY C PAM ZHANG\nAfter I read How Much of These Hills is Gold in 2020, C Pam Zhang became an instant must-read author in my household. Land of Milk and Honey is entirely unlike her debut \u2014 where her debut\u2019s language was sparse and pointed, this book is florid and indulgent \u2014 though similar in the extent to which it transported me somewhere entirely new, and more than a little threatening.\n\nIn Land of Milk and Honey the climate apocalypse has rendered fresh produce, at scale, a thing of the past \u2014 which is to say a provision of the extremely rich. The protagonist, listless and hungry, applies for a job as a private chef for a mysterious family in the Italian Alps (those who live around it call it \u201c\u200b\u200bla terra di latte e miele\u201d). While there, she unravels the family\u2019s true intentions, while making them delicious meals from rare ingredients.\n\nZhang sensuously describes all pleasures of the tongue, moving from descriptions of lapping of culinary delicacies to the folds of the flesh. Food feels hyperreal, with an emphasis on the texture and taste of every ingredient \u2014 and sometimes the cruelty of that ingredient\u2019s procurement. The same can be said of its scenes depicting queer intimacy; that texture and taste take precedent, and the cruelties of human emotion, too. Even after I finished, I was hungry for more. \u2014N. Clark\n\nCover image for Megan Kamalei Kakimoto\u2019s Every Drop is a Man\u2019s Nightmare, featuring a red and yellow flower against a painted backdrop.\nImage: Bloomsbury\nEVERY DROP IS A MAN\u2019S NIGHTMARE BY MEGAN KAMALEI KAKIMOTO\nThis short story collection initially caught my attention with its cover, which depicts a woman springing up from the center of a corpse flower, like a stalk standing against the wind. Each story weaves together Hawaiian mythology and the everyday lives of the Hawaiian and mixed-race Japanese women who live there.\n\nThese stories range from fabulism to science fiction, all speculative fiction in their own way. In one story, a woman\u2019s encounter with a wild pig ends up foreshadowing a complicated pregnancy later in her life. In another story, a Brazilian waxing company allows people to pay for hairless skin by giving up personality traits. In another story, the narrator falls for a woman who lives with her family \u2014 in one of numerous queer stories in the collection \u2014 but has to cope with that woman\u2019s decision to return to \u201cwhat remains of Kaua\u2019i\u201d and join their protests.\n\nThe author\u2019s own words, published in The Guardian, sum it up best: \u201cThere is a mythical idealisation of the islands of Hawaii as paradise, peace in the tropics; some even call it a modern utopia. Yet this flattening of Hawaii to a postcard image divests our homeland of its culture and colour, reducing us to a place and history that is easily digestible. But we are not easily digestible, and our stories are not meant to be easy for you.\u201d \u2014N. Clark\n\nCover image for Shelley Parker-Chan\u2019s He Who Drowned the World, a painted image of ships on a yellow sea, with the moon looming over them.\nImage: Tor\nHE WHO DROWNED THE WORLD (THE RADIANT EMPEROR #2) BY SHELLEY PARKER-CHAN\nAn alternate history of the founding of the Ming dynasty, He Who Drowned the World shifts between four tragically ambitious figures willing to pay any price to materialize their destiny, whether that\u2019s revenge on the empire or crowning themselves the ruler of it. They pursue these goals with unshakeable inertia, doing endlessly cruel and sadistic actions with only the occasional doubts as to whether happiness could be possible if they chose a different path.\n\nThis is a relentlessly brutal sequel, and there\u2019s a hopelessness that weighs heavy throughout the book. But Parker-Chan\u2019s penetrating ability to bring empathy and nuance into even the darkest corners of humanity sparks an undeniable connection with these characters, whose self-destructive natures would otherwise be too hard to bear witness to. He Who Drowned the World is a dark and difficult read, yet Parker-Chan\u2019s prose is so brilliant, her character work so complex, that I still found myself sad to leave this world behind. \u2014SG\n\nCover image for M.A. Carricks\u2019s Labyrinth\u2019s Heart, featuring a mask-wearing figure with purple wings sprouting out of the top of the mask.\nImage: Orbit\nLABYRINTH\u2019S HEART (ROOK & ROSE #3) BY M.A. CARRICK\nOne of my favorite fantasy series of the past five years, Rook & Rose is an intricately layered trilogy where there are so many secrets, schemes, and conspiracies that at times it\u2019s admittedly difficult to keep track of them all. Because of that, there were a lot of loose ends to tie up in the anticipated conclusion, Labyrinth\u2019s Heart. (Ren alone was juggling four different identities at the novel\u2019s start.) So imagine my surprise when I discovered M.A. Carrick not only managed to leave no question unanswered by the series\u2019 end, but wrapped up even the most complicated storylines in big, bright bows.\n\nThere are elements of Labyrinth\u2019s Heart that feel like they were precisely crafted to cater to fans, but here\u2019s the thing: I don\u2019t really care. Carrick created such a lush world populated by lovable characters, an interesting magic system, and a lived-in cultural history that I was just happy to be back in Nade\u017era after a two-year wait. While things may have been tied up a bit too neatly for my usual tastes, that didn\u2019t stop me from whipping through pages and smiling the whole way through. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to simply soak in a happy ending rather than bathe in the bittersweet. \u2014SG\n\nCover art for Kiersten White\u2019s Mister Magic, which features a melting television against a pink background.\nImage: Del Rey Books\nMISTER MAGIC BY KIERSTEN WHITE\nThe latest fantasy-with-an-irresistible-pop-premise from the author of Hide, Mister Magic revolves around a children\u2019s TV show no viewer can forget \u2026 or prove it ever existed in the first place. There are no official records of it, no YouTube videos or merchandise or passed-around VHS tapes, and any discussion of it on the internet rapidly disappears. But the people who remember seeing it are convinced the special effects were remarkably vivid and realistic. They agree the central concept is unnerving: a creepy magician-figure leading a group of children in imagination-games aimed at teaching some decidedly non-standard lessons about embracing conformity and meekness. And they\u2019re all sure that something horrible happened while they were watching, though they can\u2019t agree on what.\n\nA reunion between five of the former child cast members, taking place 30 years after the show ended, slowly unravels its mysteries, which are even weirder than the description above suggests. Mister Magic is a startling dark fantasy with a lot of foreboding, foreshadowing, and eerie twists. At heart, though, it\u2019s also an incisive story about the kinds of people who revel in control over other people\u2019s lives, and about what an act of rebellion imagination can be. \u2014Tasha Robinson\n\nCover image for Rebekah Bergman\u2019s The Museum of Human History, featuring a painted image of a naked figure with a red cloud over the top of their head.\nImage: Tin House\nTHE MUSEUM OF HUMAN HISTORY BY REBEKAH BERGMAN\nA poetic reflection on memory, loss, and connection, The Museum of Human History is a stunning debut reminiscent of the work of Emily St. John Mandel. Slipping backward and forward in time, this introspective mosaic weaves between an identical twin whose sister fell asleep at age 8 and has never aged in the 25 years since, a museum director who questions his place within the family legacy, a widower who lost his most cherished memories as a result of an anti-aging treatment, and others equally struggling with the passage of time. There is a lyrical detachment in Bergman\u2019s prose that leaves you feeling like you\u2019re watching events unfold through a pane of thick glass, never fully able to connect with the characters, yet you remain helplessly transfixed by the haunting cycle they\u2019re caught in. It\u2019s an incredibly melancholy book, but the kind of aching sadness you\u2019re happy to sink into. \u2014SG\n\nCover image for Sara Hashem\u2019s The Jasad Heir, featuring what looks like statues of a snake,, a bull, and a griffin.\nImage: Orbit Books\nTHE JASAD HEIR (THE SCORCHED THRONE #1) BY SARA HASHEM\n\u201cArin of Nizahl was maddeningly elegant. I wanted to cut him open and compare our bones to understand why his gave him grace and mine gave me back pain.\u201d This was the line that absolutely sold me on The Jasad Heir, an irresistible enemies-to-lovers fantasy that reminded me why I\u2019ll never quit this genre.\n\nHeadstrong Sylvia is the presumed dead heir of Jasad, a kingdom that was destroyed by the neighboring Nizahl and saw its citizens\u2019 innate magic outlawed. Sylvia managed to carve out a relatively normal life for herself as a chemist\u2019s apprentice, but everything falls apart after she accidentally reveals her magic to the heir of Nizahl. Using her life as leverage, the calculating Arin strikes a deal with Sylvia to help him capture a group of Jasadi rebels and act as his champion in a series of deadly trials. It\u2019s a familiar setup, but one impeccably done by Hashem, who delivers sharp political intrigue, sparkling banter, and touching friendships on top of Sylvia and Arin\u2019s simmering romance. \u2014SG\n\nCover image for Kritika H. Rao\u2019s The Surviving Sky, featuring a floating island overgrowing with buildings and plant life, above a stormy planet.\nImage: Titan Books\nTHE SURVIVING SKY (THE RAGES TRILOGY #1) BY KRITIKA H. RAO\nAfter I finished The Surviving Sky, I wouldn\u2019t shut up about it and tried (not always successfully) to get everyone I know to read it. So let me try once more, and maybe with less yelling this time:\n\nWith the planet\u2019s surface made unlivable by catastrophic storms, the remains of humanity survive on floating cities constructed of and powered by plants that only a select group of people, known as architects, can control. An archeologist without the ability to traject plants, Ahilya has dedicated her life to finding a way to unshackle humanity\u2019s survival from the architects\u2019 powers and return to the surface. It\u2019s not hard to see why this mission causes friction in her marriage to Iravan, one of the most powerful architects in their city, and one with an arrogance to match his revered status. Though estranged, Ahilya and Iravan come together to help clear his name after he\u2019s accused of pushing his powers dangerously far, an accusation, which if proved true, carries dire consequences for the architect.\n\nBut the deeper they look into trajection and its risks, the more Ahilya and Iravan realize they don\u2019t actually know much about where their people \u2013 and their powers \u2013 came from. And as the floating cities begin to sink toward the earthrages below, the race to save their civilization may also be the end of society as it stands, as Ahilya and Iravan uncover long-buried truths that previous generations worked hard to keep hidden.\n\nSo did I do it? Did I convince you to read this Hindu philosophy-inspired debut with some of the most inventive world-building and one of the most complex romances I\u2019ve read in years? Please say yes. You\u2019ll be doing us both a favor. \u2014SG\n\nCover image for Alexander Darwin\u2019s The Combat Codes, which features a metallic dragon against a black background.\nImage: Orbit\nTHE COMBAT CODES AND GRIEVAR\u2019S BLOOD (THE COMBAT CODES SAGA #1-2) BY ALEXANDER DARWIN\nIn the world of The Combat Codes, war no longer exists as it used to. Neither does justice \u2014 both concepts have been replaced by proxies who fight on behalf of nations or individuals, solving disputes with their fists.\n\nAlexander Darwin\u2019s debut novel effectively builds a world around this core concept, bringing it to life with compelling characters and locations (including a classic \u201cmagical school for gifted youngsters\u201d situation). The Combat Codes follows Cego, a young abandoned boy skilled at fighting, and Murray, a washed-up former fighter now tasked with scouting the next generation of combatants, whose discovery of Cego changes his entire world.\n\nDarwin is also a Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner and teacher, and uses that experience in the books\u2019 excellent fight sequences. His evocative and visceral descriptions not only deliver excitement and suspense in this underdog story; they build your understanding of the characters through how they fight. The Combat Codes and its equally fun sequel, Grievar\u2019s Blood, which adds new exciting characters and points-of-view, are the first two parts of a planned trilogy, and I can\u2019t wait for the conclusion next year. \u2014Pete Volk\n\nCover image for Katie Williams\u2019 My Murder, showing a woman\u2019s face peering outside of red vertical lines.\nImage: Riverhead Books\nMY MURDER BY KATIE WILLIAMS\nFans of Sarah Gailey\u2019s The Echo Wife won\u2019t want to miss My Murder, which shares some key elements and themes with Gailey\u2019s novel while also taking them in a unique direction. In a near-future with only a few light sci-fi elements, Lou has been resurrected along with a handful of other women murdered by a single serial killer. The politics of resurrection in her world are complicated, and few people qualify. That leaves her and her fellow victims (whose therapy circle recalls Grady Hendrix\u2019s The Final Girl Support Group) a bit at sea as they try to come to terms with their deaths, which none of them can recall, and their new lives as celebrities for all the wrong reasons.\n\nLike The Echo Wife, My Murder ends up thoughtfully exploring issues around women subjected to violent men \u2014 not just the personal and internal response, but the society that shapes that violence, and responds to it in ways that raise endless questions. The victims all respond to their deaths differently, questioning their culpability and the possible failures that might have made them targets, and navigating their families\u2019 unpredictable responses to their revival. There\u2019s one big mystery at the heart of My Murder, and a whole lot of abrupt and compelling surprises. But at the core, it\u2019s a sci-fi twist on the survivor story, letting some very different people explore what it means to be victimized, and how to reclaim the lives that have been abruptly handed back to them. \u2014TR\n\nCover image for Ann Leckie\u2019s Translation State, a minimalist drawing with red, orange, and green, a silhouette of a person, and circular lines.\nImage: Orbit\nTRANSLATION STATE BY ANN LECKIE\nSet in the same universe as Leckie\u2019s Imperial Radch trilogy, Translation State follows Enae, who leaves hir long-standing isolation for what was supposed to be an interstellar goose chase. After hir demanding grandmaman dies, Enae is given a diplomat title and assigned to investigate a missing Presgr translator no one expects to be found (but that the government still wants the goodwill for pretending to look for). Only, Enae doesn\u2019t just pretend to look; sie discovers sie has quite the knack for investigating the 200-year-old cold case.\n\nThis is how hir path crosses that of Reet, an adopted maintenance worker whose mysterious origins and unsettling impulses might be explained by being the child of the fugitive translator, if you ask Enae, or the last descendant of a lost sovereign line, if you ask one particularly zealous diaspora social group. Rounding out the POV characters is Qven, a young Presgr terrified of their species\u2019 ritual of merging with an elder, a rite of passage which will see Qven\u2019s selfhood entirely dissolved. Enae, Reet, and Qven\u2019s explorations of their own identities wind up having interplanetary consequences, but it\u2019s the way Leckie gives weight to the small moments, both personal and shared, that make this book sing.\n\nThough I\u2019m sure there are layers that only those familiar with the Imperial Radch trilogy will notice and appreciate, the standalone Translation State and its rich exploration of self-identification and personhood serve as a fantastic introduction to Leckie\u2019s world. So don\u2019t hesitate to jump into Translation State if you\u2019re \u2013 like me \u2013 new to Radch and simply drawn to a thrilling mystery where the most intimate emotions can fuel a universal upheaval. \u2014SG\n\nCover image for Rita Chang-Eppig\u2019s Deep as the Sky, Red as the Sea, with facial features set against a crashing wave.\nImage: Bloomsbury Publishing\nDEEP AS THE SKY, RED AS THE SEA BY RITA CHANG-EPPIG\nI still remember standing in my local bookstore, struck by the cover of this book, and reading the summary. It had me at \u201cChinese pirate queen.\u201d\n\nIn Deep as the Sky, Red as the Sea, Chang-Eppig writes a historical fantasy about Shek Yeung, a fearsome Chinese pirate who must navigate her fleet after the death of her powerful husband. She marries her late husband\u2019s second-in-command, with the promise of bearing an heir, in order to retain power over the fleet \u2014 and stay a major player as the Chinese Emperor seeks to rid the waters of piracy.\n\nThe book isn\u2019t paced like a thriller, so don\u2019t make the mistake of assuming so when you start it. It\u2019s equal parts historical exposition, strategy, and warfare \u2014 and it especially excels in its characterization of a complicated woman forced to make difficult decisions and sacrifices in order to protect her power. Fantasy can put its villains and heroes on pedestals, but Deep as the Sky, Red as the Sea never errs in its very human portrayal of Shek Yeung, and how deftly she must play this game of political chess for survival. I was riveted. \u2014N. Clark\n\nCover art for Emma T\u00f6rzs\u2019 Ink Blood Sister Scribe, featuring a dripping pen growing out of the bottom of a tree against a purple background.\nImage: William Morrow\nINK BLOOD SISTER SCRIBE BY EMMA T\u00d6RZS\nThere\u2019s nothing cozier than a magical book about the magic of books \u2014 though this tale bends a little darker, and tells a story about witchcraft and complicated family dynamics. In Ink Blood Sister Scribe, two estranged sisters come together to solve the mystery of their family, and prevent further tragedies. In this world, blood can be concocted into ink \u2014 wielded by scribes for the creation of books with arcane powers \u2014 though the creation of such books drains a scribe\u2019s health. When others read these books, they create magic; willing flowers to bloom, or making magical carpets that can fly in the air.\n\nInk Blood Sister Scribe is the perfect sister thriller to read in one sitting. It doesn\u2019t reinvent the wheel, but it doesn\u2019t need to \u2014 it simply delivers on a wonderfully entertaining premise. \u2014N. Clark\n\nCover art for Martha Wells\u2019 Witch King, featuring a person running across the cover while wearing a cloak and dress fitting for a fantasy setting.\nImage: Tor\nWITCH KING BY MARTHA WELLS\nIn an era where a lot of fantasy fans value quick or cozy reads, Martha Wells\u2019 Witch King feels like a gauntlet thrown at readers\u2019 feet. It\u2019s a complex, meaty fantasy that opens well into what a more linear book would consider the third act, as Kai, the witch king of the title, is exhumed from a watery grave and starts exploring who betrayed him and trapped him there. Readers have to learn everything about Kai\u2019s world as his story unfolds in multiple intertwined timelines. That includes figuring out what a \u201cwitch king\u201d is, unwrapping the layers of what Kai actually is and why it matters. It also means being introduced to a wide variety of allies and enemies while alternately flashing back to how he met them, and slowly coming to understand the dense political machinations that shaped all their lives in the past and present.\n\nAs with Wells\u2019 Murderbot books and her Books of the Raksura series in particular, part of the draw here is a powerful, skilled protagonist whose biggest struggles are often internal. Kai has a lot of intense emotional responses to the world, but lacks the tools to understand what to do with those feelings, or who to trust with them. Wells packs Witch King with a lot of audacious, expansive world-building for a standalone novel (albeit one that could easily invite sequels or prequels), but what makes Witch King an enjoyable read instead of a frustrating one is the way all the book\u2019s complications and surprises are filtered through Kai\u2019s vivid inner life, giving readers something to hold onto as they\u2019re untangling the puzzlebox aspects of this cleverly structured novel. \u2014TR\n\nCover image for Justin Lee Anderson\u2019s The Lost War, featuring five figures walking through white grass after emerging from a dark green forest. Three of the figures wear green cloaks, while two wear white.\nImage: Orbit\nTHE LOST WAR (THE EIDYN SAGA #1) BY JUSTIN LEE ANDERSON\nOriginally self-published in 2019, The Lost War is a traditional fantasy adventure that follows a rag-tag group of strangers on a mission across a war-torn country, fighting monsters and uncovering mysteries along the way. Despite the strong buzz leading up to the novel\u2019s expanded publication by Orbit this year, I found myself hesitant to pick it up since it seemed so similar to many books I\u2019ve read before. But while it\u2019s true The Lost War doesn\u2019t rewrite the genre \u2013 it\u2019s filled with well-worn tropes and classic adventurer archetypes \u2013 Anderson\u2019s skillful execution left me completely charmed. There is a real Dungeons and Dragons feel to The Lost War, and though the characters are familiar (the honorable paladin, the hard-drinking haunted soldier), Anderson does a fantastic job developing unique dynamics between the party members that vault the book beyond the sum of its parts. And it all builds up to a massive twist at the end that completely upends your understanding of what you\u2019ve read and any previous expectations for where the second book will go. The delightfully unexpected ending once again has the fantasy community buzzing ahead of Anderson\u2019s next release \u2013 only this time I\u2019m right there with them. \u2014SG\n\nCover image for Moniquill Blackgoose\u2019s To Shape a Dragon\u2019s Breath, a red cover with flowers and a dragon\u2019s head\/mask on it.\nImage: Del Rey\nTO SHAPE A DRAGON\u2019S BREATH (NAMPESHIWEISIT #1) BY MONIQUILL BLACKGOOSE\nTo Shape a Dragon\u2019s Breath\u2019s description hooked me immediately: It\u2019s got dragons, a magic school, and a strong teenage main character. Moniquill Blackgoose has taken several different fantasy tropes and created a fantasy novel that\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve read; To Shape a Dragon\u2019s Breath is set in an evolving steampunk world as Anglish settlers push the Indigenous Masquapaug people out of their land and onto a remote island. Dragons had long been important cultural touchstones to the Indigenous people, but colonization has, too, pushed them away. To Shape a Dragon\u2019s Breath begins as 15-year-old Anequs finds a dragon egg \u2014 the first to be spotted in the area in generations. Anequs is named a Nampeshiweisit, or a dragon rider, as the community helps raise and hatch the dragon\u2019s egg.\n\nThe colonizing nation quickly finds out and forces Anequs and her dragon into the Anglish dragon school; if she resists, the dragon will be eliminated. To Shape a Dragon\u2019s Breath is about the growing relationship between her and her dragon Kasaqua, but also about her resistance to the Anglish traditions relating to dragons. The Anglish treat dragons as something to be conquered \u2014 they use them as tools and weapons, whereas the Indigenous people have historically partnered with dragons for a relationship built on both tradition and respect.\n\nThat partnership means Anequs now has the power to take on colonialism and racism in a new way. Where To Shape a Dragon\u2019s Breath really shines is in that growing relationship between Anequs and Kasaqua; the partnership \u2014 and power for both that comes with it \u2014 is in stark contrast to the Anglish ways. Bonus: To Shape a Dragon\u2019s Breath has well-written, complex bisexual and neurodivergent characters, too. \u2014Nicole Carpenter\n\nCover image for Melvin Burgess\u2019s Loki, a black cover with a black snake wrapped around gold letters with the title.\nImage: Pegasus\nLOKI BY MELVIN BURGESS\nMelvin Burgess has spent a career writing confrontationally frank children\u2019s literature like Junk, his 1990s book about heroin-addicted teenagers. His first adult book, published at age 69, is a blistering, transgressive, and hugely entertaining reframing of the Norse myths, as told by the most unreliable narrator imaginable: Loki himself, the god of tricks, inventions, and political intrigue. But what does reliable mean, anyway, in the mutable world of myth? Burgess paints Loki (or rather, has him paint himself, as he addresses the reader directly in first person) as an eternal outsider, shaking his head sagely at the follies of the gods, and challenging their might-is-right order. But of course, that\u2019s what he\u2019d want us to think. Burgess\u2019 best trick, though, is the way he rolls together the deeply weird, muddy, shape-shifting mystery of the tales themselves with a bracing modernity in characterization and language, somehow without one clashing with the other. In doing so he brings the wild, ancient power of the Norse myths to vivid life. \u2014Oli Welsh\n\nCover image for Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah\u2019s Chain-Gang All-Stars, featuring a scythe chopping through the words with a bright yellow background.\nImage: Pantheon Books\nCHAIN-GANG ALL-STARS BY NANA KWAME ADJEI-BRENYAH\nIn Chain-Gang All-Stars, prison inmates fight to the death in a series of gladiatorial matches \u2014 and all of it is televised to a hungry audience. It\u2019s a program called CAPE, the Criminal Action Penal Entertainment, which promises freedom to inmates who survive three years of its brutality. The average life expectancy for anyone who enters is three months. Within this system, Loretta Thurwar and Hammara Stacker (called Hurricane Staxxx by her fans) emerge as two frontrunners.\n\nThis National Book Award finalist takes on the viciousness of the carceral system, with more than a bit of The Hunger Games\u2019 DNA sprinkled in. \u201cHard action\u201d fans salivate over matches, a self-obsessed announcer resents the fact that contestants don\u2019t offer more banter, and the women who top the leaderboards become sex symbols in pop culture. But where other fight-to-the-death dystopias \u2014 among the greats, like Battle Royale or Lord of the Flies \u2014 spin a more fantastical yarn, Chain-Gang All-Stars is aimed right at the heart of the all-too-real cruelties of our existing for-profit penal system.\n\nEarly in the book, Thurwar kills a 16-year-old boy in a gladiator match. Fans in the stands lament not the death of the boy, but the idea that the fight wasn\u2019t entertaining because it wasn\u2019t a fair matchup. In a footnote, Adjei-Brenyah writes of George Stinney Jr., a 14-year-old Black boy who was convicted for murder and executed in 1944. Chain-Gang All-Stars also illustrates the ways in which imprisonment is simply \u201cslavery by another name,\u201d showing all manner of menial labor the contestants are forced to perform. In 2022, the ACLU reported that inmates made between 13 and 52 cents an hour, and sometimes nothing.\n\nCritics have said this book is an \u201cact of protest\u201d but that it doesn\u2019t \u201cstraightforwardly preach,\u201d or that it\u2019s more entertaining than \u201can attempt to convince its readers of the case for prison abolition has any right to be.\u201d I understand why you\u2019d want to say this book is \u201cfun\u201d despite an abolitionist message, especially in a political climate where radical writing is often appreciated only as a teaching tool. But I think that kind of delineation undercuts Adjei-Brenyah\u2019s talent as a novelist, and his skill in heightening the real as a form of storytelling. I\u2019d call it thrilling, over calling it fun. And the fact that it is thrilling is inextricable from its openly abolitionist values \u2014 it\u2019s the very knowledge of real life that Adjei-Brenyah wields to craft suspense. \u2014N. Clark\n\nCover image for Rebecca Yarros\u2019 Fourth Wing, which features a circle image behind black text, with clouds and some flying creatures.\nImage: Entangled\nFOURTH WING BY REBECCA YARROS\nThis action-packed, fantasy romance feels like a grown up version of all of my favorite young adult books. It\u2019s got all of the fun nostalgic tropes \u2014 a magical school, deadly trials, dragon riding, and a love triangle between the main character, a golden retriever love interest, and a misunderstood emo rival \u2014 but it\u2019s also extremely horny, as all fun fantasy romance must be.\n\nViolet Sorrengail is thrown into a series of trials in order to prove whether she can be a dragon rider. There are a few problems with this: she trained as a scribe, never thought she\u2019d be thrust into danger, and she also must deal with Xaden Riorson, her sworn enemy (wink). She also manages a joint condition, which leaves her in chronic pain \u2014 a fact the book handles gracefully. In one of my favorite climactic moments of the book, Violet is given a mobility device to help her with her trials; those close to her remind her that it doesn\u2019t diminish her power, but is a tool like any other, and one that allows her to flourish. I\u2019m thrilled to read the next installment, when it comes out in November. \u2014N. Clark\n\nCover art for Adrian Tchaikovsky\u2019s Lords of Uncreation, which shows a spaceship approaching what looks like a space battle next to a planet, with exploding orbs in space and a lot of spaceships in the distance.\nImage: Orbit\nLORDS OF UNCREATION (THE FINAL ARCHITECTURE #3) BY ADRIAN TCHAIKOVSKY\nReading the Final Architecture series, I had to accept long ago that I would never fully grasp the nuances of some of its central concepts, even if I understood them on an instinctual level.\n\nThis acceptance set me up well for Lords of Uncreation, which revolves around concepts that even the characters find impossible to understand, and whose minds may literally break if they try to. Like looking directly into the sun, confronting the blurred space between the real and unreal (as well as the eldritch terrors that lurk within) poses a grave threat to those doing so head-on \u2013 at least to anyone other than weary intermediary Idris Tellemier, whose risk is merely reduced rather than eliminated. But the characters Adrian Tchaikovsky has populated this world with are so grounded, so emotionally rich, and so vibrant that the details of the brain-bending threats lurking within unspace become secondary to their impact on the lives of and relationships between the Vulture God\u2019s crew.\n\nThis is not to say that Tchaikovsky does not deliver an incredibly satisfying conclusion to the mysteries of unspace (he does!). But what I\u2019ll remember most is how he crafted the perfect emotional resolution to this intellectually intricate tale that left me in tears and has stayed with me since. \u2014SG\n\nLead art for Justin Cronin\u2019s The Ferryman, which pictures a cloudy sky over the horizon, as a single sail boat sits on the water.\nImage: Ballantine Books\nTHE FERRYMAN BY JUSTIN CRONIN\nProctor Bennett is a ferryman, whose duty is to guide unhappy citizens from the utopian Propersa to the Nursery, where they retire their old selves before returning in younger bodies with no memories of their former lives. But when Proctor is assigned to retire his own father, the troubling encounter sends him careening off the path of conformity. He begins questioning prescribed truths and confronting the darker side of Prospera, which runs off the work of a disenfranchised support staff whose discontent is building towards a revolution that pulls Proctor into its orbit.\n\nThough this premise may feel familiar, The Ferryman is anything but. This tightly-wound, atmospheric thriller weaves together layers of knotted mystery with Proctor\u2019s haunting POV as he grapples with his relationship to grief, happiness, family, and identity. It\u2019s a sharply complex mystery with a cinematic quality to it. Throughout reading, I couldn\u2019t help but fan-cast who would star in a Christopher Nolan adaptation of it. But even if you aren\u2019t an Inception fan, it\u2019ll be easy to become immersed in The Ferryman\u2019s distinct dystopian world. \u2014SG\n\nCover image for Emily Tesh\u2019s Some Desperate Glory, featuring a woman walking confidently in front of a wall opening to reveal a planetary body.\nImage: Tor\nSOME DESPERATE GLORY BY EMILY TESH\nAround September, as the pile of unpainted plastic miniatures here in my home office began to get particularly deep, I suddenly ran out of Warhammer 40,000 Black Library audiobooks by Games Workshop that I was the least bit interested in listening to. That\u2019s when I stumbled upon Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh. Billed as a space opera told from the perspective of one of humanity\u2019s last genetically engineered super soldiers, I fell for the premise hook, line, and sinker. Then, about 50 pages in, I let it sucker-punch me right in the gut.\n\nWith Some Desperate Glory, Tesh has envisioned a deeply affecting reality where the children of a subjugated, war-torn race slowly come to realize that they have been lied to \u2014 manipulated into an amoral war of vengeance without end. Tesh shows incredible restraint throughout, reeling out a thick and binding thread of painful realizations from deep within the main character, Kyr. After grappling with my personal love for the grim darkness of the far future for quite a few years now, this book helped me come to terms with how much I despise those tropes even as I find myself drawn toward them time and time again.\n\nSome Desperate Glory is, in my opinion, required reading for anyone who has ever painted a Space Marine in earnest \u2013 and a new fixture in the canon of queer science fiction. \u2014Charlie Hall\n\nCover image for Jade Song\u2019s Chlorine, featuring a large fin in the ocean waves.\nImage: William Morrow & Company\nCHLORINE BY JADE SONG\nI think I have been waiting my whole life for this book \u2014 for someone to write adolescence like the body horror it is, with all of the cultural specificity of being a Chinese American girl, simply bursting at the seams with sapphic longing. Chlorine stars Ren Yu, a swimmer who believes that she is a mermaid. But she is tethered to land by her human ambition: By the parents who constantly push her to achieve, and by a swim coach who pays inappropriate attention to her \u2014 pushing her to swim faster times, while also making her feel uncomfortable in her skin.\n\nRen\u2019s steadfast belief in being a mermaid feels both like a flight of fancy, and increasingly like a means of dissociating from the horrors of everyday life. Being a young girl is hard enough without having to contend with the high expectations of parents, the predation of adult men, and the casual racism of peers. Jade Song\u2019s writing is gruesomely lyrical, contrasting the sublime with the deeply disturbing. There were several points where this book almost made me throw up, and I mean that as a high compliment. \u2014N. Clark\n\nA Black woman stands alone in a field, her face covered by shadow, in the cover art for Lone Women by Victor LaValle.\nImage: One World\nLONE WOMEN BY VICTOR LAVALLE\nAdelaide Henry is traveling to Montana, where she plans on making a new life as a homesteader \u2014 leaving the flames of her California home, and the bodies of her parents, behind. But she has a heavy weight to carry. She lugs an enormous steam trunk wherever she goes; whenever the trunk opens, people around her die. In 1915, Montana is in the middle of a homestead boom, and though Adelaide aims to make a new start, not everyone is welcoming to a Black woman traveling alone.\n\nVictor LaValle mixes horror and fantasy in this expertly paced tale. It\u2019s satisfyingly bloody, while making incisive commentary on the price of being an outsider. The Western genre has long fixated on the white imagination, perhaps occasionally making space for the early struggle of the suffragettes. But LaValle\u2019s vision of history emphasizes just how powerful white women are in upholding the interests of their white husbands, and how far these women will go to protect the societal structures that put them in proximity to power. Lone Women also examines how shame, and the family unit, ultimately uphold these unspoken rules \u2014 ostracizing those who might otherwise find community support.\n\nThis book was so good that I am now reading my way through every interview LaValle has given on the Lone Women press circuit, too, and then reading every book he references. What a gift! \u2014N. Clark\n\nCover image of Nathan Ballingrud\u2019s The Strange, depicting a diner on Mars.\nImage: Gallery\/Saga Press\nTHE STRANGE BY NATHAN BALLINGRUD\nNathan Ballingrud\u2019s debut novel was added to my TBR pile after seeing it marketed as a blend of Ray Bradbury\u2019s The Martian Chronicles and Charles Portis\u2019 True Grit. I\u2019m always dubious about marketing comparisons, but was thrilled when The Strange delivered on this high promise.\n\nIn an alternate history where humanity colonized Mars in the early 1900s, the red planet has lost all communication with Earth, leaving the fate of 14-year-old Annabelle Crisp\u2019s mother unknown. When a thief steals Annabelle\u2019s sole voice recording of her mom, she and her beloved Kitchen Engine, Watson, set off into the desert to retrieve what\u2019s hers and see justice served. The longer Annabelle\u2019s adventure goes on, the more she loses perspective and drifts away from righteousness in dogged pursuit of her own selfish desires. Struggling to comprehend that the world can\u2019t be divided into binaries like right or wrong and black or white, Annabelle converts her fear into anger, lashing out and harming those around her, including those providing aid.\n\nAnnabelle can be vengeful and cruel, and though I often disagreed with her choices, Ballingrud makes it impossible not to understand and empathize with her. Annabelle Crisp isn\u2019t a hero and she isn\u2019t a villain, but she is an outstanding protagonist in a wonderfully original sci-fi tale. \u2014SG\n\nCover image for Moses Ose Utomi\u2019s The Lies of the Ajungo, featuring a figure walking upside down on mounds of sand as a castle lurks in front.\nImage: Tor\nTHE LIES OF THE AJUNGO (THE FOREVER DESERT #1) BY MOSES OSE UTOMI\nIn his debut novella, Moses Ose Utomi wields his precise prose to tell a dark, visceral fable about a young boy from the City of Lies, a metropolis reliant on the brutal Ajungo Empire for their supply of water. But the cost of this trade is high: At 13, every child of the City of Lies has their tongue cut out and sent to the Ajungo.\n\nEven with this gruesome tithe, the Ajungo send barely enough water for the population to survive, and far from what they\u2019d need to do so comfortably, let alone thrive. Shortly before his thirteenth birthday, the brave Tutu sets out on a dangerous journey to save his mother and the city by finding their own water supply. As Tutu explores the outside world for the first time, his perception of truth and history is challenged, and he comes to understand how the decisions and deceptions of those in power rewrite the past and shape the future to uphold those with privilege and foster compliance in those who don\u2019t. \u2014SG\n\nCover image for Edward Ashton\u2019s Antimatter Blues, A Mickey7 Novel. It features an astronaut from behind on a rocky planet, looking out at another planet in the distance.\nImage: St. Martin\u2019s Press\nANTIMATTER BLUES BY EDWARD ASHTON\nEdward Ashton\u2019s sequel to Mickey 7, the 2022 novel Parasite director Bong Joon-ho is adapting as a movie starring Robert Pattinson, takes up two years after the first book left off, with \u201cExpendable\u201d-status planetary colonist Mickey still on the outs with the leadership of his struggling colony after a gutsy bluff he made to ensure his own survival. The sixth clone of the original Mickey, who accepted life as a disposable body for suicide missions in exchange for a ticket to space, Mickey 7 has walked off that job. His ongoing draw on the colony\u2019s resources is only tolerated because he\u2019s exaggerated his diplomatic connections with the local aliens. Then the base commander orders him to do something impossible, or the entire colony will die.\n\nAntimatter Blues is knottier than the first book in the series, with more to take in about the ethics of survival and humanity\u2019s predisposition toward xenophobia and selfish, self-serving behavior. It sure isn\u2019t a pleasant book to read: A lot of Mickey\u2019s co-colonists are bigots, most of them are indifferent to anyone else\u2019s suffering, and at times, the book reads as though Earth deliberately sent all the worst people into space, the better to be free of them. Even Mickey himself is, at absolute minimum, generally more focused on his own safety and comfort than on the horrific results of some of his choices. But as soon as he\u2019s placed in what seems like an unsurvivable situation, that dynamic leads to high drama, and Antimatter Blues becomes a breathless book rocketing to a surprising conclusion. Prepare to feel sorry for various alien races who have to deal with icky humanity. \u2014TR\n\nCover image for Samantha Shannon\u2019s A Day of Fallen Night, a colorful image with a a dragon swirling around it\nImage: Bloomsbury\nA DAY OF FALLEN NIGHT (THE ROOTS OF CHAOS #0) BY SAMANTHA SHANNON\nSamantha Shannon\u2019s A Day of Fallen Night is her second book in the Roots of Chaos series, but a prequel to The Priory of the Orange Tree. Like The Priory of the Orange Tree, A Day of Fallen Night is an epic, far-flung fantasy novel set in a world of magic and dragons. A Day of Fallen Night is set hundreds of years before The Priory of the Orange Tree, and follows several of the original book\u2019s ancestors as the world fears the return of an evil wyrm, the Nameless One. You don\u2019t have to have read The Priory of the Orange Tree to enjoy A Day of Fallen Night; in fact, it\u2019s likely a good place to start if you\u2019ve been interested in reading Shannon\u2019s original, massive fantasy book. Of course, this is a slow-burn 800-page book that precedes another 800-page book, so it\u2019s definitely a time investment regardless of the path.\n\nThough A Day of Fallen Night deals with a world-shaping, cataclysmic threat and widespread political machinations, the book is rooted within four characters from around the book\u2019s world: Sabran, Glorian, Dumai, and Tunuva Melim. The stories of these characters intertwine as their regional beliefs tied to wyrms and dragons conflict, muddying up the necessary collaboration in fighting off the looming threat. In between all that catastrophe, Shannon gives the women of the book rich stories of personal relationships, sacrifice, and conflicting feelings. Motherhood and bodily autonomy are also strong themes throughout the book; both Sabran and Glorian (mother and daughter) have their bodily autonomy tied to the fate of their region.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to describe A Day of Fallen Night in a short blurb \u2014 it does so many things and goes so many places. Shannon\u2019s created a series that has the scale of The Lord of the Rings, wrapped up in a world of queer, female power. The Roots of Chaos, as a whole, is one of my favorite fantasy series ever. \u2014N. Carpenter\n\nCover image for Mariana Enriquez\u2019s Our Share of Night, featuring a red hand with long yellow fingernails.\nImage: Hogarth Press\nOUR SHARE OF NIGHT BY MARIANA ENR\u00cdQUEZ\nThis literary tome defies categorization, so I\u2019ll paint a scene instead: A father (Juan) whisks his son (Gaspar) away on a trip. Juan is mercurial; at turns terrifying and violent, at turns bewilderingly tender, nearly infinite in love. But he is a closed book. And if you think you\u2019ve seen his hands elongate, spindly fingers yielding to piercing claws \u2014 well no, you didn\u2019t.\n\nSlow, dreadful, and razor-sharp, Our Share of Night charts a family\u2019s desperate attempt at escaping the clutches of a death cult in Argentina. Its members seek the secrets of immortality, and many are willing to pay any price to obtain it. Set in 1981, the novel\u2019s supernatural terrors intertwine with those of the Dirty War, the authoritarian violence offering cover for the cult to operate uninhibited.\n\nI will read anything Mariana Enr\u00edquez writes next, it\u2019s an absolute joy to experience her work. \u2014N. Clark\n\nCover image for Annalee Newitz\u2019s The Terraformers, which features a futuristic cityscape with lush greenery.\nImage: Tor Books\nTHE TERRAFORMERS BY ANNALEE NEWITZ\nThe Terraformers concerns itself with one question: As a species evolves, what behaviors stick around? Set more than 50,000 years in the future (yes, you read that number right), The Terraformers details the process of terraforming and developing a privatized planet into a tourism joint for the super rich. Technology has advanced in barely fathomable ways, allowing, for instance, the extension of human-level intelligence to animals and robots. But some aspects of society might seem familiar: Real estate developers who jack up rent with no warning? Local governments that abhor public transit? That every video call still has one person who can\u2019t get the camera to work?\n\nEqual parts prescient and absurd, The Terraformers splits its story over three novellas, each 700 years apart. One of those stars a sentient train who teams up with an investigative journalist ... who also happens to be a cat ... who\u2019s also trying to prove this ostensibly privatized planet is in fact public land. Written by a leading science journalist of our era (author Annalee Newitz is the founder of io9 and has written for basically every major science publication under our sun), The Terraformers is unexpectedly one of the most accurate representations of the journalistic process I\u2019ve ever read. And it all culminates in an undeniable stance: That capitalistic power must still be held in check by the truth. Even 50,000 years in the future, a free press is among society\u2019s most essential facets. The more things change... \u2014Ari Notis\n\nThe cover image of Adrian Tchaikovsky\u2019s Children of Memory, which depicts a spaceship approaching a large orange planet.\nImage: Orbit\nCHILDREN OF MEMORY (CHILDREN OF TIME #3) BY ADRIAN TCHAIKOVSKY\nAdrian Tchaikovsky\u2019s highly anticipated third book in the Children of Time trilogy once again delves into some of science fiction\u2019s headiest topics. There are parallels to earlier installments \u2014 Tchaikovsky once again uses another hyper-intelligent animal species to examine the idea of what being \u201calive\u201d really means. But he also takes readers somewhere completely and utterly new, outside the scope of the previous titles, and incredibly difficult to describe without spoiling the premise entirely.\n\nAll I can say is hold on for the ride. This is an author who dives head first into Asimov-esque ideas, and who is willing to take the plot in fanciful directions. I still can\u2019t believe that I have recommended a book about sentient spider colonies to so many friends, but here we are. This finale is worth your time. \u2014N.

{"document_index":5,"context":"How to Maximize Your Impact as a Data Scientist\n\nOne of the hardest pills to swallow as an Individual Contributor (IC) at work is that nobody cares about the hard work you put in. They don\u2019t even care about your output; they care about the impact you drive.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference? Your output is the analysis you deliver, or the lines of code you write. Your impact is the decision your analysis helps the CEO make, or the revenue the new product feature is generating.\n\n\nImage by author\nIf you want to establish yourself as a high performer and accelerate your career as a Data Scientist, it\u2019s key to focus on impact.\n\nIn this post I\u2019ll go over the following:\nWhy prioritizing impact matters not just for managers, but also ICs\nWhy focusing on impact is hard\nHow to maximize your impact\nHow to overcome common challenges in driving real impact\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nGet an email whenever Torsten Walbaum publishes.\nGet an email whenever Torsten Walbaum publishes. By signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don't already\u2026\nmedium.com\n\nWhy should I focus on impact; isn\u2019t that my manager\u2019s job?\nOf course you can leave it to your manager to worry about impact. But stepping up comes with some real benefits for your career:\n\nReduced frustration & burn-out: Putting a lot of work into a project and then feeling like it didn\u2019t move the needle is one of the most frustrating feelings in any job.\nPromotions: Promotions are heavily tied to impact. And if you want to become a manager, you\u2019ll need to show that you understand what drives business outcomes and can allocate resources accordingly.\nInternal opportunities: People around you notice if you are having an outsized impact, and you\u2019ll increase your chances of receiving internal offers. My promotion to Director happened because the CMO noticed my work on the BizOps team and asked me to move into the Marketing org to build out a Strategy & Analytics team.\nExternal opportunities: Prospective employers don\u2019t focus on what responsibilities you had, but what your impact was. After all, they are trying to figure out how you can help their business.\nWhy isn\u2019t everyone doing this?\nBecause it\u2019s hard.\n\nWe are used to thinking about inputs and outputs rather than impact in our daily lives (\u201cI went to the gym\u201d or \u201cI did three loads of laundry\u201d) and we carry that mindset over to our jobs.\n\nMore importantly, it gives us a sense of control. It\u2019s fully under your control to work hard on the project, and maybe to create the final deliverable, but you can\u2019t guarantee that it will actually move the business forward.\n\nIt can also feel like we\u2019re doing someone else\u2019s job. You built the dashboard; now it\u2019s the other team\u2019s problem how they\u2019re going use it and get value from it. You can definitely take this stance; but don\u2019t you want to see your work move the needle?\n\nLastly, sometimes it\u2019s unclear what impact even looks like for our role because we feel too disconnected from the business outcomes; I\u2019ll get into this below.\n\nHow can I become more impact-focused?\nStep 1: Understand what impact looks like for your role and measure your success accordingly\nStop thinking about productivity metrics like \u201cI launched 5 experiments\u201d or \u201cI built this model\u201d and hold yourself accountable to driving impact.\n\nBut what does that look like for a Data Scientist? For other roles it\u2019s easy; Account Executives have sales quotas and Growth Marketing Managers have lead generation targets.\n\nBut Data Science, at its core, is a function that supports other teams. As a result, there are two levels of impact:\n\n\nImage by author\nDid your work change anything for the better for your business partners? E.g.:\n\nDid your analysis change the roll-out strategy of the new product?\nDid your model improve forecast accuracy?\nDoes your dashboard save the team hours every week that they used to spend on manual data pulls?\nDid your work help move the needle on downstream business metrics? E.g.:\n\nYou\u2019re a Marketing Data Scientist? Assume you\u2019re on the hook for hitting lead and opportunity targets, and improving Marketing efficiency\nYou\u2019re doing Analytics for the Customer Support org? Start obsessing about response times and satisfaction scores.\nYou don\u2019t have to be solely responsible for something in order to take (partial) credit for it. If you provided the analysis that resulted in a pricing change that saved the company millions, then you deserve part of the credit for that impact.\n\nYou might not feel the consequences of missing these downstream targets as immediately as your stakeholders, but since your long-term career trajectory is still tied to driving impact, it helps to adopt this outcome-focused mindset.\n\nOnce you start doing this, you\u2019ll notice more inefficiencies you can help address, or new opportunities for growth.\n\nStep 2: Ensure your work solves a real business problem\nYou\u2019ll likely know this situation: Instead of approaching you with a problem, people ask you for a specific deliverable. An analysis, a model, a dashboard.\n\nIf you blindly execute what they ask, you might realize too late that it won\u2019t lead to tangible business impact. Maybe the problem they are trying to solve is not that important in the grand scheme of things, or there is a better way to approach it.\n\nSo what can you do?\nAct like an owner. Understand the actual problem behind the request, and ask yourself what business priority this supports.\n\nIf you are early in your career then your manager should ideally help with this. But don\u2019t rely on this: Managers don\u2019t always do a perfect job, and you\u2019ll be the one to feel the consequences of badly scoped work.\n\nThis requires you to understand company level priorities and the priorities of other orgs and teams. Take notes during All Hands meetings etc. to understand the big picture, and get your hands on other team\u2019s planning materials to get an idea of what they\u2019re trying to accomplish in the next 1\u20132 quarters.\n\nStep 3: Ensure there is buy-in for your work\nEven if your work directly supports company-level priorities, you\u2019ll be in for a bad time if key stakeholders are not bought in.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be in a situation where you finish the work and then realize that another team is blocking the implementation because they have concerns you didn\u2019t address. To avoid this, you\u2019ll:\n\nNeed to understand whose support you need, and\nGet them onboard from the get-go\nThis is a complex topic in itself; I\u2019ll write a separate deep dive on how to drive alignment and get buy-in from other teams in the near future.\n\nStep 4: Focus your time on the highest-impact thing\nNo matter what role you\u2019re in, you\u2019re likely juggling multiple priorities. To maximize your impact, you need to ensure you spend the majority of your time on the most important thing.\n\nAs with many things, this is easier said than done though, so let\u2019s talk about what that looks like concretely.\n\nAd-hoc requests vs. strategic work\nIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in the craziness of daily business only to realize you didn\u2019t make any progress on the big, strategic project you actually care about.\n\nThis is all too common; none of us get to sit in our ivory tower and chip away at our projects undisturbed. Plus, ad-hoc work is impactful, too; while it\u2019s less exciting than strategic projects, it\u2019s what keeps the business running.\n\nStill, if you find yourself spending the majority of your time fielding these ad-hoc issues, it\u2019s time to talk to your manager. I\u2019m sure your manager would rather help protect your bandwidth than have you 1) miss your deadlines on your key projects and 2) quit eventually from frustration.\n\n\nImage by author\nDon\u2019t cry over spilled milk\nAnother common challenge comes from the sunk cost fallacy. You invested a lot of time into a project, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere. Maybe you realized the premise didn\u2019t make as much sense as you thought, or the priorities of the business have changed since you started the work.\n\nInstead of talking to your manager and stakeholders about changing the scope of the project or abandoning it altogether, you\u2019re doubling down to get it over the finish line. After all, you don\u2019t want all of your effort to go to waste. Sound familiar?\n\nEconomists (and Poker players) figured out a long time ago that this is a dangerous trap. When prioritizing your time, ignore how much effort your already put in and focus on where the next hour of work will yield the most impact.\n\nThings to watch out for (\u201cimpact killers\u201d)\nHow do you minimize the odds of wasting time on a project that won\u2019t lead to impact? There are a few warning signs:\n\n\u201cAcademic\u201d projects: Any time a project is pitched to you along the lines of \u201cThis would be interesting to understand\u201d you should be careful; projects that purely improve the understanding of an issue without tying it back to the business are a waste of time and source of frustration in my experience\nOverly ambitious project scope: At Uber, everyone always wanted to understand what the \u201cbest\u201d driver incentive type is. Many people worked on this over the years, but it never led anywhere. There was no simple \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d answer to this question, and the projects that led to actual impact were much more concrete, tactical optimizations\nThe customer or deliverable are not defined: If it\u2019s not clear who the end user of your work is (are you doing this for your manager, leadership, or another team?), or you\u2019re unsure what exactly you\u2019re supposed to deliver, it should raise a red flag. This is typically a sign that the project needs more scoping work before someone should start running with it\nCommon Challenges and How to Address Them\nWe talked about general frameworks to maximize impact. But how do you make actual, specific projects more impactful?\n\nMany times, projects fail close to the finish line. Impact doesn\u2019t materialize automatically, so you need to put in the final bit of work to ensure your work gets adopted. Doing this has an extremely high return on the time you invest since you already did the hard work to produce the deliverable and \u201conly\u201d need to close the loop with stakeholders.\n\n\nImage by author\nTo make things more tangible, I am going to go through a few types of common deliverables, touch on where they typically fail to create impact and propose what you can do about it:\n\n1. You create a comprehensive analysis but nobody is acting on it\nProblem: This is common with analyses that don\u2019t have a clear recommendation. If you simply outline the data and potential paths forward, you are expecting your audience to do all of the heavy lifting.\n\nSolution: Your work starts adding real value for them once you take that work off their plate. Always give a clear recommendation; you can caveat it and show alternatives in the appendix, but you need to take a stance.\n\n2. You ran an experiment but nobody is using the results\nProblem: Many experiments conclude with a metrics read-out by Data Science. More often than not, this is a \u201cmetrics dump\u201d with a lot of information, but little interpretation or context.\n\nSolution: Help your business partners interpret the results, and tell them how it affects what they care about.\n\nHow should they think about the statistical significance or lack thereof?\nIs the observed lift good compared to other changes you tested and shipped?\nWhat is your recommendation for next steps? What does the experiment result mean for this person or team specifically?\nRemember, you are the subject matter expert and shouldn\u2019t expect non-analytical audiences to interpret raw experiment data. Telling your stakeholders what the result means for them will increase chances they will act on it.\n\n3. You built a predictive model, but the team you built it for is not using it\nProblem: When predictive models don\u2019t get used, it\u2019s often because of a lack of trust in the model output.\n\nML models themselves tend to be black boxes, and if teams don\u2019t understand how the outputs were generated and whether they are reliable, they are hesitant to rely on them. Even if your model is not using ML and lives in a spreadsheet: If people don\u2019t know how it works, they\u2019ll be suspicious.\n\nSolution: It\u2019s all about involving stakeholders in the process and building trust.\n\nInvolve stakeholders in the model development from the get-go to get them comfortable and address any concerns early on\nDemystify the output; for example, you can extract the top model features and explain them\nSanity-check predictions and compare them to intuition. For example, if you forecast sales but your model predicts a different seasonality pattern from previous years, you\u2019ll need to be able to explain why, or you\u2019ll lose trust. In my experience, this is more impactful than just sharing performance metrics like the accuracy of the model\nHaving a structured playbook for how to do this will make your life easier, so I\u2019ll cover this in a separate post in the near future.\n\n4. You created a dashboard but nobody is looking at it\nProblem: If a dashboard doesn\u2019t get used, it\u2019s likely one of these things is true:\n\nThe dashboard doesn\u2019t directly address an urgent business use case\nYou didn\u2019t involve your stakeholders along the way (e.g. by sharing mock-ups and drafts for feedback) and the final product is not what they were hoping for\nThe dashboard is complex and your users don\u2019t understand how to get what they need\nSolution: To address #1 and #2, start with user research to understand pain points and potential use cases of the dashboard, and involve your stakeholders during development.\n\nWith regards to #3, a simpler dashboard that users are comfortable with beats a more advanced one that doesn\u2019t get used. If you cannot (or don\u2019t want to) simplify the dash further, you\u2019ll need to train your users on the functionality and shadow them to understand any points of friction.\n\nA dashboard is not done when you ship it for the first time, but needs to be improved over time based on users\u2019 needs and feedback.\n\nClosing Thoughts\nFocusing on impact is scary since we leave the world of controllable inputs behind, but it\u2019s what ultimately gets you promotions and new job opportunities.\n\nAnd isn\u2019t it nice when your work actually feels like it moves the needle?\n\nFor more hands-on analytics advice, consider following me here on Medium, on LinkedIn or on Substack.","query":"What are the given examples of common challenges?","ground_truth":"The given examples of common challenges are: \"you create a comprehensive analysis but nobody is acting on it\"; \"you ran an experiment but nobody is using the results\"; \"you built a predictive model, but the team you built it for is not using it\"; and \"you created a dashboard but nobody is looking at it\".","response_correct":"The listed challenges include: creating an analysis that goes unused, conducting experiments without implementation, building models that aren't adopted, and developing dashboards that aren't utilized.","response_wrong":"The examples of common challenges are: writing a code that nobody understands, designing a product with no usage instructions, implementing features without proper testing, and launching campaigns with unclear goals."}
{"document_index":19,"context":"A Survey on Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation for Large Language\nModels\nYizheng Huang\nYork University\nhyz@yorku.ca\nJimmy X. Huang\nYork University\njhuang@yorku.ca\nAbstract\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmerges retrieval methods with deep learning\nadvancements to address the static limitations\nof large language models (LLMs) by enabling\nthe dynamic integration of up-to-date external\ninformation. This methodology, focusing\nprimarily on the text domain, provides a\ncost-effective solution to the generation of\nplausible but incorrect responses by LLMs,\nthereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability\nof their outputs through the use of real-world\ndata. As RAG grows in complexity and\nincorporates multiple concepts that can\ninfluence its performance, this paper organizes\nthe RAG paradigm into four categories:\npre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and\ngeneration, offering a detailed perspective\nfrom the retrieval viewpoint. It outlines\nRAG\u2019s evolution and discusses the field\u2019s\nprogression through the analysis of significant\nstudies. Additionally, the paper introduces\nevaluation methods for RAG, addressing\nthe challenges faced and proposing future\nresearch directions. By offering an organized\nframework and categorization, the study\naims to consolidate existing research on\nRAG, clarify its technological underpinnings,\nand highlight its potential to broaden the\nadaptability and applications of LLMs.\n1 Introduction\nThe advent of ChatGPT has significantly impacted\nboth academia and industry due to its interactive\ncapabilities and widespread application, establishing itself as a leading artificial intelligence tool\n(Laskar et al., 2023; Jahan et al., 2023; Huang\nand Huang, 2024). At the core of ChatGPT is the\nlarge language model (LLM) GPT-4, as detailed by\n(OpenAI et al., 2023), which has seen numerous\nenhancements to its predecessors, showcasing exceptional abilities in a variety of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tasks (Laskar et al., 2020). Despite these advancements, the adoption of LLMs\nFigure 1: An example of RAG benefits ChatGPT resolves questions that cannot be answered beyond the\nscope of the training data and generates correct results.\nhas highlighted several critical issues primarily due\nto their reliance on extensive datasets. This reliance\nrestricts their ability to incorporate new information post-training, leading to three primary challenges. First, the focus on broad and general data\nto maximize accessibility and applicability results\nin subpar performance in specialized areas. Second,\nthe rapid creation of online data, combined with the\nsignificant resources required for data annotation\nand model training, hinders LLMs\u2019 ability to stay\nupdated. Third, LLMs are susceptible to generating convincing yet inaccurate responses, known as\n\u201challucinations\u201d, which can mislead users.\nAddressing these challenges is crucial for LLMs\nto be effectively utilized across various domains. A\npromising solution is the integration of RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG) technology, which\nsupplements models by fetching external data in\nresponse to queries, thus ensuring more accurate\nand current outputs. Figure 1 illustrates how RAG\ncan enable ChatGPT to provide precise answers\nbeyond its initial training data.\nSince its introduction by Lewis et al. (Lewis\net al., 2020b) in 2020, RAG technology has undergone significant advancements, particularly influenced by ChatGPT\u2019s success. However, there is a\nnoticeable gap in the literature regarding a thorough\nanalysis of RAG\u2019s mechanisms and the progress\nmade by subsequent studies. Furthermore, the field\nis characterized by diverse research focuses and the\nuse of ambiguous terminology for similar methods,\nleading to confusion. This paper aims to clarify these aspects by offering a structured overview of\nRAG, categorizing various methods, and delivering an in-depth understanding of this research area.\nThis survey will primarily focus on textual applications of RAG, reflecting the current emphasis of\nresearch efforts in this area.\nRAG combines retrieval methods and advanced\ndeep learning to address two main questions: effectively retrieving relevant information and generating accurate responses. The workflow of RAG\nis outlined in Section 2, categorizing the methodologies into pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval,\nand generation phases. These sections, from 3 to\n6, provide an in-depth analysis of the technologies\nwithin these phases. Section 7 offers summaries of\nthe reviewed studies, along with the retrievers and\ngenerators utilized. Section 8 details the evaluation\nmethodologies for RAG. Section 9 explores future\nresearch directions, concentrating on text-based\nstudies and extending to image and multimodal\ndata considerations. The conclusion is presented in\nSection 10.\nThe contributions of this paper are threefold:\nThis paper offers a comprehensive framework for\nunderstanding the RAG domain, identifying areas\nfor improvement and challenges for future research.\nIt provides a detailed analysis of RAG\u2019s core technologies, examining their strengths in addressing\nretrieval and generation. Additionally, it introduces\nthe evaluation methods used in RAG research, highlighting current challenges and suggesting promising directions for future studies.\n2 RAG Framework\nThe hallucinations are largely attributed to LLMs\u2019\ninability to access up-to-date information. This\nlimitation stems from the models\u2019 reliance on their\ntraining datasets. RAG proposes a solution to this\nissue by supplementing the LLM\u2019s training data\nwith current information from external sources\nthrough a retrieval model, thereby enabling the generation of accurate responses. RAG presents a more\ncost-effective alternative to the extensive training\nand fine-tuning processes typically required for\nLLMs. It allows for the dynamic incorporation\nof fresh information via traditional retrieval methods or pre-trained LMs, without the need to directly\nintegrate this new data into the LLM. This feature\nmakes RAG both flexible and scalable, facilitating its application across different LLMs for various purposes. The information retrieved through\nRAG is derived from real-world data, authored\nby humans, which not only simplifies the generation process but also increases the reliability of\nthe generated responses. Figure 2 represents the\nunified RAG framework with basic workflow and\nparadigm.\nResearch by Khandelwal et al. (Khandelwal\net al., 2020) demonstrates that accessing relevant\ninformation from the training dataset itself can significantly improve LLM performance, highlighting the effectiveness of RAG. Over time, RAG\nhas evolved from a means of providing supplementary information to enabling multiple interactions\nbetween the retrieval and generation components.\nThis involves conducting several rounds of retrieval\nto refine the accuracy of the information retrieved\nand iteratively improve the quality of the generated output. Platforms such as LangChain1\nand\nLlamaIndex2 have modularized the RAG approach,\nenhancing its adaptability and expanding its range\nof applications. Despite these platforms employing\ndiverse methodologies to tackle different aspects of\nRAG\u2014from multiple search iterations to iterative\ngeneration\u2014they maintain adherence to the fundamental RAG workflow. This consistency is crucial\nfor understanding their operation and pinpointing\nopportunities for further development.\n2.1 Basic RAG Workflow\nThe foundational workflow of RAG begins with the\ncreation of an index comprising external sources.\nThis index serves as the basis for retrieving relevant\ninformation through a retriever model based on a\nspecific query. The final step involves a generator\nmodel, which combines the retrieved information\nwith the query to produce the desired output.\n2.1.1 Indexing\nEfficient retrieval begins with comprehensive indexing, where data preparation is key. This stage\ninvolves text normalization processes such as tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words\nto enhance the text\u2019s suitability for indexing (Manning et al., 2008). Text segments are then organized\ninto sentences or paragraphs to facilitate more focused searches, allowing for the pinpointing of segments containing pertinent keywords. The integration of deep learning has revolutionized indexing\nthrough the use of pretrained LMs for generating\nsemantic vector representations of texts. These vectors are stored, enabling rapid and precise retrieval from extensive data collections, significantly\nenhancing retrieval efficiency.\n2.1.2 Retrieval\nWhile traditional retrieval methods, such as the\nBM25 algorithm (Hancock-Beaulieu et al., 1996),\nfocus on term frequency and presence for document\nranking, they often overlook the semantic information of queries. Current strategies leverage pretrained LMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), which\ncapture the semantic essence of queries more effectively. These models improve search accuracy by\nconsidering synonyms and the structure of phrases,\nthereby refining document ranking through the detection of semantic similarities. This is typically\nachieved by measuring vector distances between\ndocuments and queries, combining traditional retrieval metrics with semantic understanding to yield\nsearch results that are both relevant and aligned\nwith user intent.\n2.1.3 Generation\nThe generation phase is tasked with producing text\nthat is both relevant to the query and reflective of\nthe information found in the retrieved documents.\nThe usual method involves concatenating the query\nwith the retrieved information, which is then fed\ninto an LLM for text generation (Li et al., 2022).\nAlthough ensuring the generated text\u2019s alignment\nand accuracy with the retrieved content presents\nchallenges, it is also essential to strike a balance between adhering closely to the source material and\ninfusing the output with creativity. The generated\ntext should accurately convey the information from\nthe retrieved documents and align with the query\u2019s\nintent, while also offering the flexibility to introduce new insights or perspectives not explicitly\ncontained within the retrieved data.\n2.2 RAG Paradigm\nThe RAG paradigm organizes research within\nthe domain, offering a straightforward yet robust\nframework to enhance LLM performance. Central to RAG is its search mechanism, crucial for\ngenerating high-quality outcomes. Therefore, this\nparadigm is structured into four main phases from\na retrieval perspective: pre-retrieval, retrieval, postretrieval, and generation. Both single-hop and\nmulti-hop retrieval approaches, encompassing iterative retrieve-generate cycles, follow this four-phase\nstructure. Figure 3 is the taxonomy tree of RAG\u2019s\ncore techniques.\n2.2.1 Pre-Retrieval\nThe pre-retrieval phase of retrieval-augmented generation lays the foundation for successful data and\nquery preparation, ensuring efficient information\nretrieval. This phase includes essential tasks to\nprepare for effective data access.\nIndexing The process starts with indexing, which\nestablishes an organized system to enable fast and\naccurate retrieval of information. The specificity\nof indexing depends on the task and data type.\nFor example, sentence-level indexing is beneficial\nfor question-answering systems to precisely locate\nanswers, while document-level indexing is more\nappropriate for summarizing documents to understand their main concepts and ideas.\nQuery Manipulation After indexing, query manipulation is performed to adjust user queries for\na better match with the indexed data. This involves query reformulation (Jansen et al., 2009;\nYu et al., 2020), which rewrites the query to align\nmore closely with the user\u2019s intention; query expansion (Huang et al., 2013), which extends the query\nto capture more relevant results through synonyms\nor related terms; and query normalization, which\nresolves differences in spelling or terminology for\nconsistent query matching.\nData Modification Data modification is also critical in enhancing retrieval efficiency. This step\nincludes preprocessing techniques like removing\nirrelevant or redundant information to improve the\nquality of results and enriching the data with additional information such as metadata to boost the\nrelevance and diversity of the retrieved content\n(Bevilacqua et al., 2022a).\n2.2.2 Retrieval\nSearch & Ranking The retrieval stage is the\ncombination of search and ranking. It focuses on\nselecting and prioritizing documents from a dataset\nto enhance the quality of the generation model\u2019s\noutputs. This stage employs search algorithms to\nnavigate through the indexed data, finding documents that match a user\u2019s query. After identifying\nrelevant documents, the process of initially ranking\nthese documents starts to sort them according to\ntheir relevance to the query.\n2.2.3 Post-Retrieval\nThe post-retrieval phase serves to refine the initially\nretrieved documents to improve the quality of text\ngeneration. This phase consists of re-ranking and\nfiltering, each aimed at optimizing the document\nselection for the final generation task.\nRe-Ranking In the re-ranking step, the documents previously retrieved are reassessed, scored,\nand reorganized. The objective is to more accurately highlight the documents most relevant to\nthe query and diminish the importance of the less\nrelevant ones. This step involves incorporating additional metrics and external knowledge sources\nto enhance precision. In this context, pre-trained\nmodels with superior accuracy but lower efficiency\ncan be effectively employed due to the limited set\nof candidate documents available (Huang and Hu,\n2009).\nFiltering Filtering aims to remove documents\nthat fail to meet specified quality or relevance\nstandards. This can be done through several approaches, such as establishing a minimum relevance score threshold to exclude documents below\na certain relevance level. Furthermore, the use of\nfeedback from users or prior relevance evaluations\nassists in adjusting the filtering process, guaranteeing that only the most relevant documents are\nretained for text generation (Khattab and Zaharia,\n2020; Huang and Huang, 2023).\n2.2.4 Generation\nThe generation stage is a crucial component of the\nRAG process, responsible for leveraging retrieved\ninformation to enhance the quality of the generated\nresponse. This stage encompasses several sub-steps\naimed at producing content that is readable, engaging, and informative.\nEnhancing At the heart of the generation phase\nis the enhancement step, where the objective is\nto merge the retrieved information with the user\u2019s\nquery to create a coherent and relevant response.\nThis includes the process of elaboration, adding\nextra details to the retrieved content to enrich it. Efforts are focused on improving the output\u2019s quality\nby increasing its clarity, coherence, and stylistic\nappeal through methods such as rephrasing and\nrestructuring. Information from various sources\nis combined to offer a comprehensive perspective,\nand verification is conducted to ensure the accuracy\nand relevance of the content.\nCustomization Customization is an optional\nstep, involving the adjustment of content to align\nwith the user\u2019s specific preferences or the context\nof the request. This tailoring includes adapting the\ncontent to meet the needs of the target audience or\nthe format in which it will be presented and condensing the information to succinctly convey the\nessence of the content. The process also entails\ncreating summaries or abstracts that emphasize the\nkey points or arguments, ensuring the output is both\ninformative and concise.\n3 Pre-Retrieval\n3.1 Indexing\nThe integration of the k-nearest neighbor (kNN)\nalgorithm with pre-trained neural LMs, as demonstrated in kNN-LMs (Khandelwal et al., 2020), represents significant progress in language modeling. This method employs a datastore created from collections of texts, enabling the dynamic retrieval of\ncontextually relevant examples to improve perplexity without necessitating additional training.\nKnown for its efficiency, FAISS (Johnson et al.,\n2021) has been adopted in many studies for indexing purposes (Khandelwal et al., 2020; Lewis et al.,\n2020b; Khattab et al., 2022). Some research integrates enhancements like the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) approximation (Malkov\nand Yashunin, 2020) to achieve faster retrieval\n(Lewis et al., 2020b). In addition, alternative tools\nlike utilizing the Bing API 3\nfor indexing based\non actual user search histories as outlined in Webgpt (Nakano et al., 2021), illustrate the variety of\nindexing techniques under investigation.\nFurthermore, MEMWALKER (Chen et al.,\n2023a) introduces an innovative method to overcome the limitations of context window size in\nLLMs by creating a memory tree from the input\ntext. This tree is formed by initially segmenting\nthe text into smaller pieces and then summarizing these segments into a hierarchical structure of\nsummary nodes, facilitating efficient indexing and\nmanagement of large volumes of information.\n3.2 Query Manipulation\nStudies such as FiD (Izacard and Grave, 2021),\nCOK(Li et al., 2023), and Query2doc (Wang et al.,\n2023a) emphasize the significance of creating new\nqueries or refining existing ones to achieve more\n3\nhttps:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/bing\/apis\/bing-websearch-api\npertinent retrieval results. These research efforts\nhighlight the necessity of efficiently gathering evidence from multiple passages and tailoring queries\nto suit various knowledge sources, whether structured or unstructured. Techniques ranging from the\ncreation of pseudo-documents to enhance queries\nhave shown to bolster retrieval performance across\ndiverse information retrieval datasets.\nFurther exploration into query manipulation has\nbeen conducted by Step-Back (Zheng et al., 2023)\nand PROMPTAGATOR (Dai et al., 2023), which\nfocus on abstracting high-level concepts or utilizing LLMs for prompt-based query generation.\nThese strategies strive to better align queries with\nthe retrieval system\u2019s functionality by rephrasing\ntasks into more generalized versions or crafting\ntask-specific queries from limited examples. Such\nmethodologies enhance the consistency between\nqueries and indexed data, facilitating the retrieval\nof more pertinent and insightful information.\nMoreover, KnowledGPT (Wang et al., 2023b)\nand Rewrite-Retrieve-Read (Ma et al., 2023) introduce approaches for query manipulation through\n\u201cprogram of thought\u201d prompting and innovative\nquery rewriting techniques. KnowledGPT innovates by generating code to interface with knowledge bases, converting user queries into structured\nsearch commands. In contrast, Rewrite-RetrieveRead utilizes a trainable compact LM for query\nreformulation, adjusting them to more effectively\nreflect the user\u2019s intent and context.\nLastly, FLARE (Jiang et al., 2023) presents a\nstrategy based on confidence for query formulation, which focuses on crafting queries that precisely\nreflect the information needs. This method incorporates the use of generated sentences or fragments\nthereof as a foundation for search queries. By opting to directly use sentences, obscuring tokens of\nlow confidence, or formulating explicit questions,\nthis approach aims to boost the efficiency of the\nretrieval process, ensuring that the retrieved information faithfully satisfies the requirements of the\ngeneration process.\n3.3 Data Modification\nRA-DIT (Lin et al., 2023b) and RECITE (Sun et al.,\n2023) emphasize enhancements through internal\ndata modifications. RA-DIT distinguishes between\nfine-tuning datasets for LLMs and retrievers, aiming to bolster the LLM\u2019s contextual comprehension\nand the retriever\u2019s ability to align with queries. RECITE, on the other hand, utilizes passage hints and\nsynthetic question-passage pairs to increase the\nvariety and relevance of its generated recitations\nand responses. This approach seeks to broaden the\nmodel\u2019s knowledge base and improve its response\naccuracy.\nUPRISE (Cheng et al., 2023a) and GENREAD\n(Yu et al., 2023a) target the refinement of external\ndata. UPRISE converts raw task data into a structured format and refines the selection of prompts\nto enhance retrieval outcomes. In contrast, the\nClustering-Based Prompts method employed by\nGENREAD generates documents from questions\nand clusters them to eliminate irrelevant data, enriching the input with varied contextual insights.\nThis technique aims to improve the performance of\nthe generative model by providing it with a richer\nset of information.\nFurthermore, KnowledGPT (Wang et al., 2023b)\nis dedicated to augmenting raw text data with structured, semantically rich information through entity\nlinking. This enrichment process not only structures the data more cohesively and makes it more\namenable to queries but also boosts the model\u2019s\nretrieval efficiency. It leverages precise, linked\nknowledge to enhance the model\u2019s understanding and its ability to generate relevant responses,\nthereby improving its overall performance.\n4 Retrieval\n4.1 Search & Ranking\nAtlas (Izacard et al., 2023) investigates few-shot\nlearning approaches, including Attention Distillation and Perplexity Distillation, to steer the retriever toward retrieving more relevant documents.\nIRCOT (Trivedi et al., 2023) integrates retrieval\nwith reasoning to improve the effectiveness of retrieval. SURGE (Kang et al., 2023) employs a\nsubgraph retriever to extract relevant subgraphs\nfrom a knowledge graph, while AAR (Yu et al.,\n2023b) modifies search preferences to help LLMs\nin fetching pertinent documents.\nPRCA (Yang et al., 2023a) focuses on employing domain-specific abstractive summarization to\nextract relevant and context-rich information from\ndocuments, using a supervised learning strategy\nto prioritize content crucial for accurate query responses. Meanwhile, MEMWALKER (Chen et al.,\n2023a) leverages an internal search and ranking\nmechanism in the constructed memory tree to identify pertinent information for long-context question\nanswering. Additionally, the Confidence-based Active Retrieval approach of FLARE (Jiang et al.,\n2023) dynamically triggers information retrieval\nbased on the confidence levels of generated sentences, utilizing the insight that low-confidence\ntokens signal a need for external knowledge.\n5 Post-Retrieval\n5.1 Re-Ranking\nRe2G (Glass et al., 2022) introduces a sequencepair classification approach for re-ranking, utilizing a BERT transformer to simultaneously analyze\nthe query and passage. This interaction model, employing cross-attention between sequences, offers a\ncontrast to the representation model typically used\nin initial retrieval phases. PROMPTAGATOR (Dai\net al., 2023) also employs a cross-attention model\nfor re-scoring. Its \u201cLift Yourself Up\u201d strategy iteratively selects the best candidate from a pool for\nfurther generation rounds, progressively improving\ncontent quality via self-generated content.\nRe-ranking is also a significant focus of InContext RALM (Ram et al., 2023). Two approaches to reranking are explored: zero-shot\nreranking using language models and predictive\nreranking through trained models. This step is\naimed at refining the selection of documents based\non their expected utility for improving language\nmodel performance. ITER-RETGEN (Shao et al.,\n2023), in particular, leverages knowledge distillation from the re-ranker to the dense retriever, finetuning retrieval efforts based on relevance signals\nfrom LLM outputs. This optimization of the retrieval model aims to more accurately capture query\nnuances, thereby improving document selection.\nDKS-RAC (Huang et al., 2023) presents the\nDense Knowledge Similarity (DKS) for aligning\nthe knowledge between answers and retrieved passages at the sequence level. This approach is categorized under re-ranking due to its direct impact on\npassage selection based on knowledge similarity,\nrefining the match between queries and documents.\nFiD-light (Hofst\u00e4tter et al., 2023) introduces a\nlistwise autoregressive re-ranking method that employs source pointers to optimize the ranking order.\nThis method maintains a link between the generated text and source passages, enabling a more\nstructured generation process. By incorporating\ntextual citations within the model\u2019s output as pointers to relevant information sources, this approach\nfacilitates an organized retrieval and generation\nprocess, enhancing the overall coherence and relevance of the generated content.\n5.2 Filtering\nCOK (Li et al., 2023) presents the Progressive Rationale Correction technique, aimed at iteratively\nrefining rationales with retrieved knowledge. This\nmethod constitutes a continuous optimization process, significantly enhancing the relevance and\nquality of information used in content generation.\nSelf-RAG (Asai et al., 2023) introduces a selfreflection mechanism to efficiently filter out irrelevant content. By employing critique tokens, this\napproach evaluates the relevance, supportiveness,\nand utility of retrieved passages, ensuring the integration of only high-quality information into the\ncontent generation process.\nAdditionally, FiD-TF (Berchansky et al., 2023)\nand RECOMP (Xu et al., 2023) are dedicated to the\nremoval of irrelevant or redundant tokens and information from retrieved documents. FiD-TF employs\na dynamic mechanism to identify and eliminate unnecessary tokens, enhancing the efficiency of information processing. RECOMP, on the other hand,\ncompresses documents into concise summaries, focusing on selecting only the most pertinent content\nfor the generation process. These methods streamline the content generation workflow by ensuring\nthat only relevant and supportive information is\nutilized, thereby improving the overall quality and\nrelevance of the generated content.\n6 Generation\n6.1 Enhancing\nDSP (Khattab et al., 2022) introduces a framework\ndesigned to generate multiple retrieval queries to\nsummarize and answer questions, drawing upon information aggregated from various passages. This\nframework employs CombSUM (Fox and Shaw,\n1994) to calculate a cumulative probability score\nfor passages across different retrieval lists, facilitating the compilation of a comprehensive response\nfrom multiple sources.\nPRCA (Yang et al., 2023a) outlines a RewardDriven Stage, wherein the distilled context is refined based on feedback from the generator. Utilizing reinforcement learning, this stage adjusts\nthe parameters of PRCA according to the rewards\nreceived for providing relevant context. The objective is to fine-tune the extracted context to meet\nthe specific requirements of the generator, thereby\noptimizing the generation process.\nREPLUG (Shi et al., 2023) proposes a method\nfor prepending retrieved documents to the input\ncontext before the final prediction by the black-box\nLM. It introduces an ensemble strategy to encode\nretrieved documents in parallel, overcoming the\nlimitations of LM context length and enhancing\naccuracy through the allocation of increased computational resources. This approach improves the\ngeneration process by ensuring that the LM has\naccess to a broader range of relevant information.\nRECITE (Sun et al., 2023) implements a selfconsistency technique, which involves generating\nmultiple recitations independently and employing\na plurality\/majority vote system to determine the\nmost appropriate answer. This method is designed\nto increase the reliability and accuracy of the answers, thereby improving the quality and credibility\nof the output.\n6.2 Customization\nThe PKG framework, introduced by (Luo et al.,\n2023), represents an approach to customizing the\noutput of LMs. By generating background knowledge internally using a pre-trained model, PKG\neliminates the need for traditional external retrieval\nprocesses. This method directly integrates domainor task-specific knowledge into the generation step,\nsignificantly enhancing the LM\u2019s capacity to produce responses that are specifically tailored to the\ngiven context or requirements.\nSelf-RAG (Asai et al., 2023) offers a strategy that incorporates reflection tokens within a customizable decoding algorithm. This technique permits dynamic adjustment of the model\u2019s retrieval\nand generation behaviors based on the specific task,\nfacilitating more versatile response generation. Depending on the requirements, this approach can be\ntuned for accuracy or creativity, providing flexibility in generating outputs that meet diverse needs.\nSURGE (Kang et al., 2023) achieves customization through the application of graph-text contrastive learning. This method ensures that the\ngenerated dialogue responses are in tight alignment\nwith the knowledge contained in the retrieved subgraph, yielding responses that are specific, relevant,\nand deeply rooted in the dialogue context. By maintaining consistency between the retrieved knowledge and the generated text, SURGE is capable\nof producing outputs that precisely reflect the detailed knowledge of the subgraph, enhancing the\nrelevance and specificity of the responses.\n7 Comparisons of RAG\n7.1 The Comprehensive Summary of RAG\nTable 1 presents a detailed analysis of the RAG\nstudies discussed in this paper. The analysis shows\nthat the majority of these studies have utilized external data sources to enrich the content of LLMs.\nA preference for multiple-hop over single-hop retrieval was noted, indicating that iterative search\nrounds generally yield superior results. In other\nwords, most methods employ dense retrieval to secure higher quality candidate documents. Compared to modifying datasets in the pre-retrieval\nstage, more studies focus on manipulating the query\nto improve retrieval performance. Additionally,\nthere is a significant emphasis on optimizing the\nretrieval phase, highlighting its crucial role in the\nresearch. However, there seems to be a scarcity\nof studies concentrating on customization in the\ngeneration stage, pointing to this as a potential area\nfor future exploration. Overall, while the goal of\nRAG is to enhance the response quality of LLMs,\ngreater efforts have been directed towards improving retrieval aspects.\n7.2 Retriever and Generator\nIn RAG, the retriever and the generator are the\nprimary components. Table 2 summarizes the retrievers and generators used in the studies discussed\nin this paper. It is clear from the table that while\nmost generators utilize advanced language models,\na significant number of retrievers still employ the\ntraditional BM25 due to its efficiency. The method\nof retrieval is a crucial aspect in RAG, highlighting the importance of exploring ways to enhance\nretrieval performance without compromising efficiency. Similarly, not many studies have adopted\npowerful LLMs such as LLaMA2, GPT-3.5, or\nGPT-4 as their generators. LLMs like T5 remain\npopular, yet fundamental models like BERT and\nTransformers are rarely used in 2023. Compared\nto generators, it is evident that not many IR-based\nLLMs are used in retrievers, indicating a promising\ndirection for developing such models in the future.\n8 Evaluation in RAG\nTo understand the effectiveness of LMs in generating more accurate, relevant, and robust responses\nby leveraging external knowledge, the evaluation\nof RAG systems has become a significant research\narea. With the popularity of dialogue-based interactions, recent works have been focused on assessing\nthe performance of RAG models on such downstream tasks using established metrics like Exact\nMatch (EM) and F1 scores. Furthermore, a wide\narray of datasets has been utilized for this purpose,\nincluding TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), HotpotQA\n(Yang et al., 2018), FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018),\nNatural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), Wizard of Wikipedia (Dinan et al., 2019), and T-REX\n(ElSahar et al., 2018).\nHowever, evaluation solely from the perspective of downstream tasks falls short in addressing\nthe evolving needs of RAG development. Recent\nresearch has introduced various frameworks and\nbenchmarks that aim to evaluate these systems\nacross multiple dimensions, including the quality\nof the generated text, the relevance of retrieved\ndocuments, and the model\u2019s resilience to misinformation, as shown in Table 3. These evaluations focus on assessing specific capabilities such as noise\nrobustness, negative prompting, information integration, and counterfactual robustness, highlighting the complex challenges faced by RAG systems\nin practical applications. The continuous development of evaluation frameworks and metrics is\ncrucial for advancing the field, broadening the applicability of RAG systems, and ensuring they meet\nthe demands of a complex and evolving information landscape.\n8.1 Retrieval-based Aspect\nIn information retrieval, the quality of search results is typically evaluated using standard metrics\nsuch as Mean Average Precision (MAP), Precision,\nReciprocal Rank, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) (Radlinski and Craswell,\n2010; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019; Nogueira et al.,\n2019). These metrics primarily assess the relevance\nof retrieved documents to a given query.\nRetrieval-based Metrics in RAG focus on the effectiveness of retrieving relevant information to\nsupport generation tasks. These include Accuracy, which measures the precision of retrieved\ndocuments in providing correct information for answering queries, and Rejection Rate (Chen et al.,\n2023b), assessing a system\u2019s ability to decline answering when no relevant information is found.\nAdditionally, Error Detection Rate (Chen et al.,\n2023b) evaluates the model\u2019s capability to identify\nand disregard incorrect or misleading information\nfrom retrieved documents. Context Relevance is\nanother essential metric, assessing the pertinence\nof the retrieved documents to the query. It\u2019s vital to\nensure the information used to generate responses\nis directly related to the query\u2019s context. Faithfulness (Shahul et al., 2023) measures the accuracy\nwith which the generated content reflects the information in the retrieved documents, ensuring that\nthe generation process with no misinformation.\n8.2 Generation-based Aspect\nEvaluating the quality of text produced by LLMs\ninvolves analyzing their performance on various\ndownstream tasks using standard metrics. These\nmetrics assess linguistic quality, coherence, accuracy, and the extent to which the generated text\nreflects ground-truth data. Linguistic quality and\ncoherence are evaluated through metrics such as\nBLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), which measures fluency and similarity to human-produced text, and\nROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), which quantifies the overlap with reference summaries to gauge the text\u2019s\ncapacity to encapsulate main ideas and phrases.\nAccuracy and overlap with ground-truth data are\ngauged using metrics like EM and F1 Score, which\nrespectively determine the percentage of answers\nthat are entirely correct and offer a balanced assessment of precision and recall in retrieving relevant\nanswers while minimizing inaccuracies.\nBeyond these standard metrics, the evaluation\nmay also incorporate task-specific criteria and\nnovel metrics tailored to particular applications.\nFor instance, in dialogue generation, perplexity\nand entropy are used to evaluate response diversity and naturalness. Additionally, metrics such as\nMisleading Rate and Mistake Reappearance Rate\n(Liu et al., 2023) gauge a model\u2019s ability to avoid\nmisinformation and inaccuracies. Other specialized metrics include Answer Relevance (Shahul\net al., 2023), assessing the precision of responses\nto queries; Kendall\u2019s tau (Saad-Falcon et al., 2023),\nfor evaluating the accuracy of RAG system rankings; Micro-F1 (Saad-Falcon et al., 2023), which\nfine-tunes accuracy evaluation in tasks with multiple correct answers; and Prediction Accuracy, directly measuring the alignment of generated answers with expected responses, thereby offering a\ndirect insight into a system\u2019s effectiveness in generating accurate content.\n9 Future Directions\n9.1 Retrieval Quality\nThe integration of RAG into LLMs faces significant\nhurdles due to the vast amounts of unreliable information on the internet, including fake news. This\npresents a challenge for accurately retrieving useful\nknowledge, leading to the unreliable generation of\nresponses by LLMs. As a result, LLMs may generate content based on incorrect information, undermining their reliability. Recent research efforts\nare directed towards enhancing retrieval methods\nto improve the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of LLMs in generating accurate and reliable\nresponses.\nDifferentiable Search Indices (Tay et al., 2022)\nand (Bevilacqua et al., 2022b) developed differentiable search indices that integrate the retrieval\nprocess within a Transformer model, enabling direct mapping of text queries to document identifiers.\nThese approaches offer superior performance and\npotential for more efficient and scalable retrieval.\nGenerative Models for Search GERE (Chen\net al., 2022a) can directly generate document titles\nand evidence sentences for fact-verification tasks.\nPARADE (Li et al., 2024) is a method for document\nreranking that aggregates passage representations\ninto a unified document relevance score. Both of\nthem demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval quality over traditional methods.\nFine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models\nRankT5 (Zhuang et al., 2023) is a model that finetunes the T5 framework specifically for text ranking. It leverages ranking losses to optimize performance metrics and exhibits promising zero-shot\nperformance on out-of-domain data.\nNoise Power (Cuconasu et al., 2024) provide a\ncomprehensive analysis of the impact of IR components on RAG systems, revealing that the inclusion\nof irrelevant documents can significantly improve\naccuracy. It challenges conventional retrieval strategies and underscores the potential for developing\nspecialized approaches that integrate retrieval with\nlanguage generation models.\n9.2 Multimodal RAG\nThe multimodal RAG domain has experienced significant growth, highlighting a pivotal advancement\nat the confluence of text and visual comprehension.\nThe introduction of MuRAG (Chen et al., 2022b)\nmarked a breakthrough by amalgamating textual\nand visual information for language generation, establishing a new standard for multimodal datasets.\nThis model showcased the efficacy of utilizing a\nmultimodal memory system to boost the accuracy\nin question-answering and reasoning tasks.\nAfter MuRAG, studies such as REVEAL (Hu\net al., 2023) and Re-Imagen (Chen et al., 2023c)\nhave focused on enhancing visual question answering and text-to-image generation. They achieved\nthis through the incorporation of dynamic retrieval\nmechanisms and the improvement of image fidelity,\nrespectively. These advancements laid the groundwork for further models by researchers like Sarto\net al. (Sarto et al., 2022) for image captioning,\nand Yuan et al. (Yuan et al., 2023) for text-to-audio\ngeneration, broadening the scope of RAG\u2019s application across different modalities and improving the\nquality and realism of the generated outputs. Furthermore, Re-ViLM (Yang et al., 2023b) refined\nimage captioning capabilities through a retrievalaugmented visual language model. By fine-tuning\nmodel parameters and implementing innovative filtering strategies, it has made strides in producing\nmore precise and contextually appropriate captions.\nBy tapping into external resources, these models\nhave provided significant enhancements over traditional benchmarks, highlighting the advantage of\nintegrating diverse sources of knowledge.\n10 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we have presented a comprehensive framework for understanding the RAG domain, highlighting its significance in enhancing\nthe capabilities of LLMs. Through a structured\noverview of RAG, categorizing various methods,\nand an in-depth analysis of its core technologies\nand evaluation methods, this study illuminates the\npath for future research. It identifies crucial areas\nfor improvement and outlines potential directions\nfor advancing RAG applications, especially in textual contexts. This survey aims to elucidate the\ncore concepts of the RAG field from a retrieval\nperspective, and it is intended to facilitate further\nexploration and innovation in the accurate retrieval\nand generation of information.\n11 Limitations\nThis survey comprehensively examines existing\nRAG models, summarizing their core techniques\ninto four main steps from a retrieval perspective. It\nrecognizes that some methods may encompass multiple steps and that decoupling these steps could\npotentially obscure their intrinsic connections. Nevertheless, the primary objective is to simplify the\ncomplexity of the approach, clearly delineating the\nspecific problems it addresses. This allows for a\nclearer identification of areas ripe for further optimization and improvement. Despite the thorough investigation, the rapid evolution of the field and\npage limits mean that certain aspects might not\nhave been fully analyzed and explored, or recent\ndevelopments could have been missed. While the\npaper references evaluation methods that can aid\nin the development of RAG, it also acknowledges\nmature tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex as\nuseful resources. However, the focus of this survey\nis not on detailing the evaluation pipeline or how\nthese tools are specifically used, but rather on illustrating how evaluation aspects can support the\nadvancement of RAG. This choice highlights an\narea for future work, emphasizing the importance\nof methodological clarity and the application of\nevaluation tools in refining and enhancing RAG\nmodels.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Natural Sciences\nand Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of\nCanada and the York Research Chairs (YRC) program.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Natural Sciences\nand Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of\nCanada and the York Research Chairs (YRC) program.\nReferences\nAkari Asai, Zeqiu Wu, Yizhong Wang, Avirup Sil, and\nHannaneh Hajishirzi. 2023.

{"document_index":5,"context":"How to Maximize Your Impact as a Data Scientist\n\nOne of the hardest pills to swallow as an Individual Contributor (IC) at work is that nobody cares about the hard work you put in. They don\u2019t even care about your output; they care about the impact you drive.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference? Your output is the analysis you deliver, or the lines of code you write. Your impact is the decision your analysis helps the CEO make, or the revenue the new product feature is generating.\n\n\nImage by author\nIf you want to establish yourself as a high performer and accelerate your career as a Data Scientist, it\u2019s key to focus on impact.\n\nIn this post I\u2019ll go over the following:\nWhy prioritizing impact matters not just for managers, but also ICs\nWhy focusing on impact is hard\nHow to maximize your impact\nHow to overcome common challenges in driving real impact\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nGet an email whenever Torsten Walbaum publishes.\nGet an email whenever Torsten Walbaum publishes. By signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don't already\u2026\nmedium.com\n\nWhy should I focus on impact; isn\u2019t that my manager\u2019s job?\nOf course you can leave it to your manager to worry about impact. But stepping up comes with some real benefits for your career:\n\nReduced frustration & burn-out: Putting a lot of work into a project and then feeling like it didn\u2019t move the needle is one of the most frustrating feelings in any job.\nPromotions: Promotions are heavily tied to impact. And if you want to become a manager, you\u2019ll need to show that you understand what drives business outcomes and can allocate resources accordingly.\nInternal opportunities: People around you notice if you are having an outsized impact, and you\u2019ll increase your chances of receiving internal offers. My promotion to Director happened because the CMO noticed my work on the BizOps team and asked me to move into the Marketing org to build out a Strategy & Analytics team.\nExternal opportunities: Prospective employers don\u2019t focus on what responsibilities you had, but what your impact was. After all, they are trying to figure out how you can help their business.\nWhy isn\u2019t everyone doing this?\nBecause it\u2019s hard.\n\nWe are used to thinking about inputs and outputs rather than impact in our daily lives (\u201cI went to the gym\u201d or \u201cI did three loads of laundry\u201d) and we carry that mindset over to our jobs.\n\nMore importantly, it gives us a sense of control. It\u2019s fully under your control to work hard on the project, and maybe to create the final deliverable, but you can\u2019t guarantee that it will actually move the business forward.\n\nIt can also feel like we\u2019re doing someone else\u2019s job. You built the dashboard; now it\u2019s the other team\u2019s problem how they\u2019re going use it and get value from it. You can definitely take this stance; but don\u2019t you want to see your work move the needle?\n\nLastly, sometimes it\u2019s unclear what impact even looks like for our role because we feel too disconnected from the business outcomes; I\u2019ll get into this below.\n\nHow can I become more impact-focused?\nStep 1: Understand what impact looks like for your role and measure your success accordingly\nStop thinking about productivity metrics like \u201cI launched 5 experiments\u201d or \u201cI built this model\u201d and hold yourself accountable to driving impact.\n\nBut what does that look like for a Data Scientist? For other roles it\u2019s easy; Account Executives have sales quotas and Growth Marketing Managers have lead generation targets.\n\nBut Data Science, at its core, is a function that supports other teams. As a result, there are two levels of impact:\n\n\nImage by author\nDid your work change anything for the better for your business partners? E.g.:\n\nDid your analysis change the roll-out strategy of the new product?\nDid your model improve forecast accuracy?\nDoes your dashboard save the team hours every week that they used to spend on manual data pulls?\nDid your work help move the needle on downstream business metrics? E.g.:\n\nYou\u2019re a Marketing Data Scientist? Assume you\u2019re on the hook for hitting lead and opportunity targets, and improving Marketing efficiency\nYou\u2019re doing Analytics for the Customer Support org? Start obsessing about response times and satisfaction scores.\nYou don\u2019t have to be solely responsible for something in order to take (partial) credit for it. If you provided the analysis that resulted in a pricing change that saved the company millions, then you deserve part of the credit for that impact.\n\nYou might not feel the consequences of missing these downstream targets as immediately as your stakeholders, but since your long-term career trajectory is still tied to driving impact, it helps to adopt this outcome-focused mindset.\n\nOnce you start doing this, you\u2019ll notice more inefficiencies you can help address, or new opportunities for growth.\n\nStep 2: Ensure your work solves a real business problem\nYou\u2019ll likely know this situation: Instead of approaching you with a problem, people ask you for a specific deliverable. An analysis, a model, a dashboard.\n\nIf you blindly execute what they ask, you might realize too late that it won\u2019t lead to tangible business impact. Maybe the problem they are trying to solve is not that important in the grand scheme of things, or there is a better way to approach it.\n\nSo what can you do?\nAct like an owner. Understand the actual problem behind the request, and ask yourself what business priority this supports.\n\nIf you are early in your career then your manager should ideally help with this. But don\u2019t rely on this: Managers don\u2019t always do a perfect job, and you\u2019ll be the one to feel the consequences of badly scoped work.\n\nThis requires you to understand company level priorities and the priorities of other orgs and teams. Take notes during All Hands meetings etc. to understand the big picture, and get your hands on other team\u2019s planning materials to get an idea of what they\u2019re trying to accomplish in the next 1\u20132 quarters.\n\nStep 3: Ensure there is buy-in for your work\nEven if your work directly supports company-level priorities, you\u2019ll be in for a bad time if key stakeholders are not bought in.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be in a situation where you finish the work and then realize that another team is blocking the implementation because they have concerns you didn\u2019t address. To avoid this, you\u2019ll:\n\nNeed to understand whose support you need, and\nGet them onboard from the get-go\nThis is a complex topic in itself; I\u2019ll write a separate deep dive on how to drive alignment and get buy-in from other teams in the near future.\n\nStep 4: Focus your time on the highest-impact thing\nNo matter what role you\u2019re in, you\u2019re likely juggling multiple priorities. To maximize your impact, you need to ensure you spend the majority of your time on the most important thing.\n\nAs with many things, this is easier said than done though, so let\u2019s talk about what that looks like concretely.\n\nAd-hoc requests vs. strategic work\nIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in the craziness of daily business only to realize you didn\u2019t make any progress on the big, strategic project you actually care about.\n\nThis is all too common; none of us get to sit in our ivory tower and chip away at our projects undisturbed. Plus, ad-hoc work is impactful, too; while it\u2019s less exciting than strategic projects, it\u2019s what keeps the business running.\n\nStill, if you find yourself spending the majority of your time fielding these ad-hoc issues, it\u2019s time to talk to your manager. I\u2019m sure your manager would rather help protect your bandwidth than have you 1) miss your deadlines on your key projects and 2) quit eventually from frustration.\n\n\nImage by author\nDon\u2019t cry over spilled milk\nAnother common challenge comes from the sunk cost fallacy. You invested a lot of time into a project, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere. Maybe you realized the premise didn\u2019t make as much sense as you thought, or the priorities of the business have changed since you started the work.\n\nInstead of talking to your manager and stakeholders about changing the scope of the project or abandoning it altogether, you\u2019re doubling down to get it over the finish line. After all, you don\u2019t want all of your effort to go to waste. Sound familiar?\n\nEconomists (and Poker players) figured out a long time ago that this is a dangerous trap. When prioritizing your time, ignore how much effort your already put in and focus on where the next hour of work will yield the most impact.\n\nThings to watch out for (\u201cimpact killers\u201d)\nHow do you minimize the odds of wasting time on a project that won\u2019t lead to impact? There are a few warning signs:\n\n\u201cAcademic\u201d projects: Any time a project is pitched to you along the lines of \u201cThis would be interesting to understand\u201d you should be careful; projects that purely improve the understanding of an issue without tying it back to the business are a waste of time and source of frustration in my experience\nOverly ambitious project scope: At Uber, everyone always wanted to understand what the \u201cbest\u201d driver incentive type is. Many people worked on this over the years, but it never led anywhere. There was no simple \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d answer to this question, and the projects that led to actual impact were much more concrete, tactical optimizations\nThe customer or deliverable are not defined: If it\u2019s not clear who the end user of your work is (are you doing this for your manager, leadership, or another team?), or you\u2019re unsure what exactly you\u2019re supposed to deliver, it should raise a red flag. This is typically a sign that the project needs more scoping work before someone should start running with it\nCommon Challenges and How to Address Them\nWe talked about general frameworks to maximize impact. But how do you make actual, specific projects more impactful?\n\nMany times, projects fail close to the finish line. Impact doesn\u2019t materialize automatically, so you need to put in the final bit of work to ensure your work gets adopted. Doing this has an extremely high return on the time you invest since you already did the hard work to produce the deliverable and \u201conly\u201d need to close the loop with stakeholders.\n\n\nImage by author\nTo make things more tangible, I am going to go through a few types of common deliverables, touch on where they typically fail to create impact and propose what you can do about it:\n\n1. You create a comprehensive analysis but nobody is acting on it\nProblem: This is common with analyses that don\u2019t have a clear recommendation. If you simply outline the data and potential paths forward, you are expecting your audience to do all of the heavy lifting.\n\nSolution: Your work starts adding real value for them once you take that work off their plate. Always give a clear recommendation; you can caveat it and show alternatives in the appendix, but you need to take a stance.\n\n2. You ran an experiment but nobody is using the results\nProblem: Many experiments conclude with a metrics read-out by Data Science. More often than not, this is a \u201cmetrics dump\u201d with a lot of information, but little interpretation or context.\n\nSolution: Help your business partners interpret the results, and tell them how it affects what they care about.\n\nHow should they think about the statistical significance or lack thereof?\nIs the observed lift good compared to other changes you tested and shipped?\nWhat is your recommendation for next steps? What does the experiment result mean for this person or team specifically?\nRemember, you are the subject matter expert and shouldn\u2019t expect non-analytical audiences to interpret raw experiment data. Telling your stakeholders what the result means for them will increase chances they will act on it.\n\n3. You built a predictive model, but the team you built it for is not using it\nProblem: When predictive models don\u2019t get used, it\u2019s often because of a lack of trust in the model output.\n\nML models themselves tend to be black boxes, and if teams don\u2019t understand how the outputs were generated and whether they are reliable, they are hesitant to rely on them. Even if your model is not using ML and lives in a spreadsheet: If people don\u2019t know how it works, they\u2019ll be suspicious.\n\nSolution: It\u2019s all about involving stakeholders in the process and building trust.\n\nInvolve stakeholders in the model development from the get-go to get them comfortable and address any concerns early on\nDemystify the output; for example, you can extract the top model features and explain them\nSanity-check predictions and compare them to intuition. For example, if you forecast sales but your model predicts a different seasonality pattern from previous years, you\u2019ll need to be able to explain why, or you\u2019ll lose trust. In my experience, this is more impactful than just sharing performance metrics like the accuracy of the model\nHaving a structured playbook for how to do this will make your life easier, so I\u2019ll cover this in a separate post in the near future.\n\n4. You created a dashboard but nobody is looking at it\nProblem: If a dashboard doesn\u2019t get used, it\u2019s likely one of these things is true:\n\nThe dashboard doesn\u2019t directly address an urgent business use case\nYou didn\u2019t involve your stakeholders along the way (e.g. by sharing mock-ups and drafts for feedback) and the final product is not what they were hoping for\nThe dashboard is complex and your users don\u2019t understand how to get what they need\nSolution: To address #1 and #2, start with user research to understand pain points and potential use cases of the dashboard, and involve your stakeholders during development.\n\nWith regards to #3, a simpler dashboard that users are comfortable with beats a more advanced one that doesn\u2019t get used. If you cannot (or don\u2019t want to) simplify the dash further, you\u2019ll need to train your users on the functionality and shadow them to understand any points of friction.\n\nA dashboard is not done when you ship it for the first time, but needs to be improved over time based on users\u2019 needs and feedback.\n\nClosing Thoughts\nFocusing on impact is scary since we leave the world of controllable inputs behind, but it\u2019s what ultimately gets you promotions and new job opportunities.\n\nAnd isn\u2019t it nice when your work actually feels like it moves the needle?\n\nFor more hands-on analytics advice, consider following me here on Medium, on LinkedIn or on Substack.","query":"What are the key topics of this article?","ground_truth":"The key topics of this article are: \"why prioritizing impact matters not just for managers, but also ICs\"; \"why focusing on impact is hard\"; \"how to maximize your impact\"; and \"how to overcome common challenges in driving real impact\".","response_correct":"The main topics are the importance of focusing on impact, challenges in doing so, ways to increase impact, and strategies to address obstacles in achieving meaningful impact.","response_wrong":"The key topics covered are the importance of input over output, ways to become a better coder, and tips for better data analysis techniques."}

UI elements automatically send their values to the Python when they are interacted with, and run all cells referencing the elements. This makes marimo notebooks responsive, but it can be an issue when the downstream cells are expensive, or when the input (such as a text box) needs to be filled out completely before it is considered valid. Forms let you gate submission of UI element values on manual confirmation, via a button press.\n\nRecipe.\n\nImport packages\n\nimport marimo as mo\nCreate a submittable form.\n\nform = mo.ui.text(label=\"Your name\").form()\nform\nGet the value of the form.\n\nform.value\nStop execution of a cell and its descendants\nUse cases.

In order to synchronize UI elements between the frontend and backend (Python), marimo requires you to assign UI elements to global variables. But sometimes you don\u2019t know the number of elements to make until runtime: for example, maybe you want o make a list of sliders, and the number of sliders to make depends on the value of some other UI element.\n\nYou might be tempted to create a Python list of UI elements, such as l = [mo.ui.slider(1, 10) for i in range(number.value)]: however, this won\u2019t work, because the sliders are not bound to global variables.\n\nFor such cases, marimo provides the \u201chigher-order\u201d UI element mo.ui.array, which lets you make a new UI element out of a list of UI elements: l = mo.ui.array([mo.ui.slider(1, 10) for i in range(number.value)]). The value of an array element is a list of the values of the elements it wraps (in this case, a list of the slider values). Any time you interact with any of the UI elements in the array, all cells referencing the array by name (in this case, \u201cl\u201d) will run automatically.\n\nRecipe.\n\nImport packages.\n\nimport marimo as mo\nUse mo.ui.array to group together many UI elements into a list.\n\nimport random\n\n# instead of random.randint, in your notebook you'd use the value of\n# an upstream UI element or other Python object\narray = mo.ui.array([mo.ui.text() for i in range(random.randint(1, 10))])\narray\nGet the value of the UI elements using array.value\n\narray.value\nCreate a dictionary of UI elements\nUse cases.

When you want to embed a dynamic number of UI elements in other outputs (like tables or markdown).\n\nRecipe.\n\nImport packages\n\nimport marimo as mo\nGroup the elements with mo.ui.dictionary or mo.ui.array, then retrieve them from the container and display them elsewhere.\n\nimport random\n\nn_items = random.randint(2, 5)\n\n# Create a dynamic number of elements using `mo.ui.dictionary` and\n# `mo.ui.array`\nelements = mo.ui.dictionary(\n    {\n        \"checkboxes\": mo.ui.array([mo.ui.checkbox() for _ in range(n_items)]),\n        \"texts\": mo.ui.array(\n            [mo.ui.text(placeholder=\"task ...\") for _ in range(n_items)]\n        ),\n    }\n)\n\nmo.md(\n    f\"\"\"\n    Here's a TODO list of {n_items} items\\n\\n\n    \"\"\"\n    + \"\\n\\n\".join(\n        # Iterate over the elements and embed them in markdown\n        [\n            f\"{checkbox} {text}\"\n            for checkbox, text in zip(\n                elements[\"checkboxes\"], elements[\"texts\"]\n            )\n        ]\n    )\n)\nGet the value of the elements\n\nelements.value\nCreate a hstack (or vstack) of UI elements with on_change handlers\nUse cases.

Toggle between two states using a button with a button that toggles between True and False. (Tip: you can also just use mo.ui.switch.)\n\nRecipe.\n\nImport packages\n\nimport marimo as mo\nUse mo.ui.button and its on_click argument to create a toggle button.\n\n# Initialize the button value to False, flip its value on every click.\nbutton = mo.ui.button(value=False, on_click=lambda value: not value)\nbutton\nToggle between two outputs using the button value.\n\nmo.md(\"True!\") if button.value else mo.md(\"False!\")\nRe-run a cell when a button is pressed\nUse cases. For example, you have a cell showing a random sample of data, and you want to resample on button press.\n\nRecipe.\n\nImport packages\n\nimport marimo as mo\nCreate a button without a value, to function as a trigger.\n\nbutton = mo.ui.button()\nbutton\nReference the button in another cell.\n\n# the button acts as a trigger: every time it is clicked, this cell is run\nbutton\n\n# Replace with your custom lgic\nimport random\nrandom.randint(0, 100)\nRun a cell when a button is pressed, but not before\nUse cases. Wait for confirmation before executing downstream cells (similar to a form).\n\nRecipe.\n\nImport packages\n\nimport marimo as mo\nCreate a counter button.\n\nbutton = mo.ui.button(value=0, on_click=lambda count: count + 1)\nbutton\nOnly execute when the count is greater than 0.\n\n# Don't run this cell if the button hasn't been clicked, using mo.stop.\n# Alternatively, use an if expression.\nmo.stop(button.value == 0)\n\nmo.md(f\"The button was clicked {button.value} times\")\nReveal an output when a button is pressed\nUse cases.

Because marimo runs cells automatically as code and UI elements change, it can be helpful to cache expensive intermediate computations. For example, perhaps your notebook computes t-SNE, UMAP, or PyMDE embeddings, and exposes their parameters as UI elements. Caching the embeddings for different configurations of the elements would greatly speed up your notebook.\n\nRecipe.\n\nUse functools to cache function outputs given inputs.\n\nimport functools\n\n@functools.cache\ndef compute_predictions(problem_parameters):\n   # replace with your own function\/parameters\n   ...\nWhenever compute_predictions is called with a value of problem_parameters it has not seen, it will compute the predictions and store them in a cache.

Tokenization is the process of mapping text to integers, which can be fed into the LLM. Our training corpus for this model will be the works of Shakespeare concatenated into one file. This is roughly 1 million characters and looks like this:\n\nFirst Citizen:\nBefore we proceed any further, hear me speak.\n\nAll:\nSpeak, speak.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nYou are all resolved rather to die than to famish?\n\nAll:\nResolved. resolved.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nFirst, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.\n...\nFirst, we read the file as a single long string into the text variable. Then we use the set() function to get all the unique characters in the text which will be our vocabulary. By printing vocab you can see all the characters in our vocabulary as one string, and we have a total of 65 characters which till be our tokens.\n\n# Creating the vocabulary\nwith open('input.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    text = f.read()\nvocab = sorted(list(set(text)))\nvocab_size = len(vocab)\n\nprint(''.join(vocab))\n# !$&',-.3:;?ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nprint(vocab_size)\n# 65\nProduction models will use tokenization algorithms like byte-pair encoding to generate a larger vocabulary of sub-word chunks. Since our focus today is on the architecture, we will continue with character-level tokenization. Next, we will map our vocabulary to integers known as token IDs. Then we can encode our text into tokens and decode them back to a string.\n\n# Create mapping from vocab to integers\nitos = {i:c for i,c in enumerate(vocab)} # int to string\nstoi = {c:i for i,c in enumerate(vocab)} # string to int\nencode = lambda x: [stoi[c] for c in x]\ndecode = lambda x: ''.join([itos[i] for i in x])\n\nprint(encode(\"hello world\"))\n# [46, 43, 50, 50, 53, 1, 61, 53, 56, 50, 42]\nprint(decode(encode(\"hello world\")))\n# hello world\nWe use theenumerate() function to iterate over all characters and their index in the vocabulary and create a dictionary itos which maps integers to characters and stoi which maps strings to integers. Then we use these mappings to create our encode and decode functions. Now we can encode the entire text and split training and validation data.\n\ndata = encode(text)\nsplit = int(0.9 * len(data))\ntrain_data = data[:split]\nval_data = data[split:]\nCurrently, our training data is just a very long string of tokens. However, we are trying to train our model to predict the next token some given previous tokens. Therefore our dataset should be comprised of examples where the input is some string of tokens and the label is the correct next token. We need to define a model parameter called context length which is the maximum number of tokens used to predict the next token. Our training examples will be the length of our context length.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the first ctx_len+1 tokens.\n\nctx_len = 8\nprint(train_data[:ctx_len + 1])\n# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47, 58]\n# x: [18, 47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47] | y: 58\nThis is one training example where the input is \u201c18, 47, 56, 57, 58, 1, 15, 47\u201d and the desired output is \u201c58\u201d. This is 8 tokens of context. However, we also want to train the model to predict the next token given only 7, 6, 5 \u2026 0 tokens as context which is needed during generation. Therefore we also consider the 8 sub examples packed into this example:\n\nctx_len = 8\nprint(train_data[:ctx_len + 1])\n# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47, 58]\n# 8 sub examples\n# [18] --> 47\n# [18, 47] --> 56\n# [18, 47, 56] --> 57\n# [18, 47, 56, 57] --> 58\n# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58] --> 1\n# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58, 1] --> 15\n# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58, 1, 15] --> 47\n# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58, 1, 15, 47] --> 58\nNotice that the labels are simply the inputs shifted left.\n\nprint(\"inputs: \", train_data[:ctx_len])\nprint(\"labels: \", train_data[1:ctx_len+1]) # labels = inputs indexed 1 higher\n# inputs: [18, 47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47]\n# labels: [47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47, 58]\nAt index 0 the input is 18 and the label is 47. At index 1 the input is everything before and including index 1 which is [18, 47] and the label is 56, etc. Now that we understand that the labels are simply the input sequence indexed one higher we can build our datasets.\n\n# Creating training and validation datasets\nctx_len = 8\nX_train = mx.array([train_data[i:i+ctx_len] for i in range(0, len(train_data) - ctx_len, ctx_len)])\ny_train = mx.array([train_data[i+1:i+ctx_len+1] for i in range(0, len(train_data) - ctx_len, ctx_len)])\nX_val = mx.array([val_data[i:i+ctx_len] for i in range(0, len(val_data) - ctx_len, ctx_len)])\ny_val = mx.array([val_data[i+1:i+ctx_len+1] for i in range(0, len(val_data) - ctx_len, ctx_len)])\nWe loop through the data and take chunks of size ctx_len as the inputs (X) and then take the same chunks but at 1 higher index as the labels (y). Then we take these Python lists and create mlx array objects from them. The model internals will be written with mlx so we want our inputs to be mlx arrays.\n\nOne more thing. During training we don\u2019t want to feed the model one example at a time, we want to feed it multiple examples in parallel for efficiency. This group of examples is called our batch, and the number of examples in a group is our batch size. Thus we define a function to generate batches for training.\n\ndef get_batches(X, y, b_size, shuffle=True):\n    if shuffle:\n        ix = np.arange(X.shape[0])\n        np.random.shuffle(ix)\n        ix = mx.array(ix)\n        X = X[ix]\n        y = y[ix]\n    for i in range(0, X.shape[0], b_size):\n        input = X[i:i+b_size]\n        label = y[i:i+b_size]\n        yield input, label\nIf shuffle=True, we shuffle the data by indexing it with a randomly shuffled index. Then we loop through our dataset and return batch-size chunks from input and label datasets. These chunks are known as mini-batches and are just stacked examples that we process in parallel. These mini-batches will be our input to the model during training.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of a minibatch of 4 examples with context length 8.\n\n\nA single minibatch (image by author)\nThis minibatch packs 32 next-token prediction problems. The model will predict the next token for each token in the input and the labels will be used to calculate the loss. Notice that the labels contain the next token for each index of the inputs.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to keep this picture in your mind because the shapes of these tensors will get hairy. For now, just remember that we will input a tensor of shape (batch_size, ctx_len) to the model.\n\nCoding GPT-2\nLet\u2019s look at the GPT-2 architecture to get an overview of what we are trying to implement.\n\n\nGPT-2 Architecture (image by author)\nDon\u2019t worry if this looks confusing. We will implement it step by step from bottom to top. Let\u2019s start by implementing the input embeddings.\n\nInput Embeddings\nThe purpose of the input embedding layer is to map token IDs to vectors. Each token will be mapped to a vector which will be its representation as it is forwarded through the model. The vectors for each token will accumulate and exchange information as they pass through the model and eventually be used to predict the next token. These vectors are called embeddings.\n\nThe simplest way to map token IDs to vectors is through a lookup table. We create a matrix of size (vocab_size, n_emb) where each row is the embedding vector for the corresponding token. This matrix is known as the embedding weights.\n\n\nEmbedding Layer (image by author)\nThe diagram shows an example embedding layer of size (65, 6). This means there are 65 tokens in the vocabulary and each one will be represented by a length 6 embedding vector. The inputted sequence will be used to index the embedding weights to get the vector corresponding to each token. Remember the minibatches we input into the model? Originally the minibatch is size (batch_size, ctx_len). After passing through the embedding layer it is size (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb). Instead of each token being a single integer, each token is now a vector of length n_emb.\n\nLet\u2019s define the embedding layer in code now.\n\nn_emb = 6 # You can add these hyperparams at the top of your file\nclass GPT(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.wte = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_emb)\nWe will define a class to organize our implementation. We subclass nn.Module to take advantage of mlx\u2019s features. Then in the init function, we call the superclass constructor and initialize our token embedding layer called wte .\n\nPositional Embeddings\nNext up is the positional embeddings. The purpose of positional embeddings is to encode information about the position of each token in the sequence. This can be added to our input embeddings to get a complete representation of each token that contains information about the token\u2019s position in the sequence.\n\nclass GPT(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.wte = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_emb) # token embeddings\n        self.wpe = nn.Embedding(ctx_len, n_emb) # position embeddings\nThe position embeddings work the same as token embeddings, except instead of having a row for each token we have a row for each possible position index. This means our embedding weights will be of shape (ctx_len, n_emb). Now we implement the __call__ function in our GPT class. This function will contain the forward pass of the model.\n\n# Tensor shapes commented\ndef __call__(self, x):\n    B, T = x.shape # (B = batch_size, T = ctx_len)\n    tok_emb = self.wte(x) # (B, T, n_emb)\n    pos_emb = self.wpe(mx.arange(T)) # (T, n_emb)\n    x = tok_emb + pos_emb # (B, T, n_emb)\nFirst, we break out the dimensions of our input into variables B and T for easy handling. In sequence modeling contexts B and T are usually used as shorthand for \u201cbatch\u201d and \u201ctime\u201d dimensions. In this case, the \u201ctime\u201d dimension of our sequence is the context length.\n\nNext, we calculate token and position embeddings. Notice that for the position embeddings, our input is mx.arange(T) . This will output an array of consecutive integers from 0 to T-1 which is exactly what we want because those are the positions we want to embed. After passing that through the embedding layer we will have a tensor of shape (T, n_emb) because the embedding layer plucks out the n_emb length vector for each of the T positions. Note that even though pos_emb is not the same shape as tok_emb we can add the two because mlx will broadcast, or replicate pos_emb across the batch dimension to allow elementwise addition. Finally, we perform the addition to get the new representations of the tokens with positional information.\n\nSelf-Attention\nSo far the representation vectors for each token have been calculated independently. They have not had the opportunity to exchange any information. This is intuitively bad in language modeling because the meaning and usage of words depend on the surrounding context. Self-attention is how we incorporate information from previous tokens into a given token.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s consider a naive approach. What if we simply represented each token as the average of its representation vector and the vectors of all the tokens before it? This achieves our goal of packing information from previous tokens into the representation for a given token. Here\u2019s what it would look like.\n\n\nimage by author\nBut self-attention doesn\u2019t involve writing a for-loop. The key insight is we can achieve this previous token averaging with matrix multiplication!\n\n\nimage by author\nBy multiplying our input sequence on the left by a special matrix we get the desired result. This matrix is known as the attention weights. Notice that each row of the attention weight matrix specificies \u201chow much\u201d of each other token goes into the representation for any given token. For example in row two, we have [0.5, 0.5, 0, 0]. This means that row two of the result will be 0.5*token1 + 0.5*token2 + 0*token3 + 0*token4 , or the average of token1 and token2. Note that the attention weights are a lower-triangular matrix (zeros in upper right entries). This ensures that future tokens will not be included in the representation of a given token. This ensures that tokens can only communicate with the previous tokens because during generation the model will only have access to previous tokens.\n\nLet\u2019s look at how we can construct the attention weight matrix.\n\n\nimage by author\nNotice that if we create an array of zeros with -inf in the upper right entries and then perform row-wise softmax we get the desired attention weights. A good exercise is to step through the softmax calculation for a row to see how this works. The takeaway is that we can take some array of size (ctx_len, ctx_len) and softmax each row to get attention weights that sum to one.\n\nNow we can leave the realm of naive self-attention. Instead of simply averaging previous tokens, we use arbitrary weighted sums over previous tokens. Notice what happens when we do row-wise softmax of an arbitrary matrix.\n\n\nimage by author\nWe still get weights that sum to one on each row. During training, we can learn the numbers in the matrix on the left which will specify how much each token goes into the representation for another token. This is how tokens pay \u201cattention\u201d to each other. But we still haven\u2019t understood where this matrix on the left came from. These pre-softmax attention weights are calculated from the tokens themselves, but indirectly through three linear projections.\n\nKeys, Queries, and Values\n\nimage by author\nEach token in our sequence emits 3 new vectors. These vectors are called keys, queries, and values. We use the dot product of the query vector of one token and the key vector of another token to quantify the \u201caffinity\u201d those two tokens have. We want to calculate the pairwise affinities of each token with every other token, therefore we multiply the query vector (4x3) with the key vector transposed (3x4) to get the raw attention weights (4x4). Due to the way matrix multiplication works the (i,j) entry in the raw attention weights will be the query of token i dot the key of token j or the \u201caffinity\u201d between the two. Thus we have calculated interactions between every token. However, we don\u2019t want past tokens interacting with future tokens so we apply a mask of -inf to the upper right entries to ensure they will zero out after softmax. Then we perform row-wise softmax to get the final attention weights. Instead of multiplying these weights directly with the input, we multiply them with the value projection. This results in the new representations.\n\nNow that we understand attention conceptually, let\u2019s implement it.\n\nclass Attention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, head_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.head_size = head_size\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n\nWe start by defining the key, query, and value projection layers. Note that instead of going from n_emb to n_emb, we project from n_emb to head_size. This doesn\u2019t change anything, it just means the new representations calculated by attention will be dimension head_size.\n\nclass Attention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, head_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.head_size = head_size\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n    def __call__(self, x): # shapes commented\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\nThe forward pass begins by calculating the key, query, and value projections. We also break out the input shape into the variables B, T, and C for future convenience.\n\nclass Attention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, head_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.head_size = head_size\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 2, 1])) \/ math.sqrt(self.head_size)\n        # attn_weights.shape = (B, T, T)\nNext, we calculate the attention weights. We only want to transpose the last two dimensions of the key tensor, because the batch dimension is just there so we can forward multiple training examples in parallel. The mlx transpose function expects the new order of the dimensions as input, so we pass it [0, 2, 1] to transpose the last two dimensions. One more thing: we scale the attention weights by the inverse square root of head_size. This is known as scaled attention and the purpose is to ensure that when Q and K are unit variance, attn_weights will be unit variance. If the variance of attn_weights is high, then the softmax will map these small and large values to 0 or 1which results in less complex representations.\n\nThe next step is to apply the mask to ensure we are doing causal language modeling i.e. ensuring tokens cannot attend to future tokens.\n\nclass Attention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, head_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.head_size = head_size\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)\n        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick\n        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 2, 1])) \/ math.sqrt(self.head_size)\n        # attn_weights.shape = (B, T, T)\nWe create the mask with a clever broadcasting trick. Let\u2019s say our ctx_len=4 like in the diagrams above. First, we use mx.arange(4) to set the indices variable to [0, 1, 2, 3].\n\n\nimage by author\nThen we can index like so indices[:, None] to generate a column vector with the values of indices. Similarly, we can get a row vector using indices[None]. Then when we do the < comparison, mlx broadcasts the vectors because they have mismatching shapes so they can\u2019t be compared elementwise. Broadcasting means mlx will replicate the vectors along the lacking dimension. This results in an elementwise comparison of two (4, 4) matrices which makes sense. Side note: I recommend familiarizing yourself with the details of broadcasting by reading this, it comes up all the time when dealing with tensors.\n\nAfter the elementwise comparison, we are left with the following tensor:\n\n[[False,  True,  True,  True],\n [False, False,  True,  True],\n [False, False, False,  True],\n [False, False, False, False]]\nMultiplying this tensor by -1e9, we get:\n\n[[-0e+00, -1e+09, -1e+09, -1e+09],\n [-0e+00, -0e+00, -1e+09, -1e+09],\n [-0e+00, -0e+00, -0e+00, -1e+09],\n [-0e+00, -0e+00, -0e+00, -0e+00]]\nNow we have an additive mask. We can add this matrix to our attention weights to make all the upper right entries very large negative numbers. This will cause them to be zeroed out after the softmax operation. Also, note that we add \u201c_\u201d as a prefix to the attribute name _causal_mask which marks it as a private variable. This signals to mlx that it is not a parameter and should not be updated during training.\n\nclass Attention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, head_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.head_size = head_size\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)\n        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick\n        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 2, 1])) \/ math.sqrt(self.head_size)\n        # attn_weights.shape = (B, T, T)\n        attn_weights = attn_weights + self._causal_mask\n        attn_weights = mx.softmax(attn_weights, axis=-1)\n        o = (attn_weights @ V) # (B, T, head_size)\nNow we can softmax row-wise to get the final attention weights and multiply these weights by the values to get our output. Note we pass axis=-1 to softmax which specifies that we want to softmax across the last dimension which are the rows.\n\nThe final step is output linear projection and dropout.\n\ndropout = 0.1 # add this with hyperparams at top of file\nclass Attention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, head_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.head_size = head_size\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)\n        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick\n        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(head_size, n_emb) # output projection\n        self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 2, 1])) \/ math.sqrt(self.head_size)\n        # attn_weights.shape = (B, T, T)\n        attn_weights = attn_weights + self._causal_mask\n        attn_weights = mx.softmax(attn_weights, axis=-1)\n        o = (attn_weights @ V) # (B, T, head_size)\n        o = self.c_proj(self.resid_dropout(o))\n        return o\nWe add two new layers, c_proj and resid_dropout which are the output projection and residual dropout. The output projection is to return the vectors to their original dimension n_emb. The dropout is added for regularization and training stability which is important as we start layering the transformer blocks to get a deep network. And that\u2019s it for implementing one attention head!\n\nMulti-Head Attention\nInstead of having just one attention head LLMs often use multiple attention heads in parallel and concatenate their outputs to create the final representation. For example, let\u2019s say we had one attention head with head_size=64 so the vector it produced for each token was 64 dimensional. We could achieve the same thing with 4 parallel attention heads each with head_size=16 by concatenating their outputs to produce a 16x4 = 64 dimensional output. Multi-head attention allows the model to learn more complex representations because each head learns different projections and attention weights.\n\nn_heads = 4\nclass MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module): # naive implementation\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.heads = [Attention(head_size \/\/ n_heads) for _ in range(n_heads)]\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        return mx.concatenate([head(x) for head in self.heads], axis=-1)\nThe straightforward implementation is to create a list of n_heads attention heads where each one has size equal to our final head size divided by n_heads. Then we concatenate the output of each head over the last axis. However, this implementation is inefficient and does not take advantage of the speed of tensors. Let\u2019s implement multi-head attention with the power of tensors.\n\nhead_size = 64 # put at top of file\nclass MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)\n        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick\n        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(head_size, n_emb) # output projection\n        self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\nWe start with our single-head attention implementation. The __init__() function has not changed. The forward pass begins as normal with the creation of the key, query, and value projections.\n\nhead_size = 64 # put at top of file\nn_heads = 8 # put at top of file\nclass MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)\n        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick\n        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(head_size, n_emb) # output projection\n        self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        mha_shape = (B, T, n_heads, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        K = mx.as_strided(K, (mha_shape)) # (B, T, n_heads, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        Q = mx.as_strided(Q, (mha_shape)) # (B, T, n_heads, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        V = mx.as_strided(V, (mha_shape)) # (B, T, n_heads, head_size\/\/n_heads)\nThe next thing we need to do is introduce a new dimension for the number of heads n_heads . In the naive implementation, we had separate attention objects each with their own key, query, and value tensors but now we have them all in one tensor, therefore we need a dimension for the heads. We define the new shape we want in mha_shape . Then we use mx.as_strided() to reshape each tensor to have the head dimension. This function is equivalent to view from pytorch and tells mlx to treat this array as a different shape. But we still have a problem. Notice that we if try to multiply Q @ K_t (where K_t is K transposed over it\u2019s last 2 dims) to compute attention weights as we did before, we will be multiplying the following shapes:\n\n(B, T, n_heads, head_size\/\/n_heads) @ (B, T, head_size\/\/n_heads, n_heads)\nResult shape: (B, T, n_heads, n_heads)\nThis would result in a tensor of shape (B, T, n_heads, n_heads) which is incorrect. With one head our attention weights were shape (B, T, T) which makes sense because it gives us the interaction between each pair of tokens. So now our shape should be the same but with a heads dimension: (B, n_heads, T, T) . We achieve this by transposing the dimensions of keys, queries, and values after we reshape them to make n_heads dimension 1 instead of 2.\n\nhead_size = 64 # put at top of file\nn_heads = 8 # put at top of file\nclass MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)\n        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick\n        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(head_size, n_emb) # output projection\n        self.attn_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n        self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        mha_shape = (B, T, n_heads, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        K = mx.as_strided(K, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        Q = mx.as_strided(Q, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        V = mx.as_strided(V, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 1, 3, 2])) \/ math.sqrt(Q.shape[-1]) # (B, n_heads, T, T)\n        attn_weights = attn_weights + self._causal_mask[:T, :T]\n        attn_weights = mx.softmax(attn_weights, axis=-1)\n        attn_weights = self.attn_dropout(attn_weights)\n        o = (attn_weights @ V) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n\nNow we can calculate the correction attention weights. Notice that we scale the attention weights by the size of an individual attention head rather than head_size which would be the size after concatenation. We also apply dropout to the attention weights.\n\nFinally, we perform the concatenation and apply the output projection and dropout.\n\nhead_size = 64 # put at top of file\nn_heads = 8 # put at top of file\nclass MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)\n        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick\n        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(head_size, n_emb) # output projection\n        self.attn_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n        self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        mha_shape = (B, T, n_heads, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        K = mx.as_strided(K, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        Q = mx.as_strided(Q, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        V = mx.as_strided(V, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 1, 3, 2])) \/ math.sqrt(Q.shape[-1]) # (B, n_heads, T, T)\n        attn_weights = attn_weights + self._causal_mask[:T, :T]\n        attn_weights = mx.softmax(attn_weights, axis=-1)\n        attn_weights = self.attn_dropout(attn_weights)\n        o = (attn_weights @ V) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        o = o.transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]).reshape((B, T, head_size)) # concat heads\n        o = self.c_proj(self.resid_dropout(o))\n        return o\nSince we have everything in one tensor, we can do some shape manipulation to do the concatenation. First, we move n_heads back to the second to last dimension with the transpose function. Then we reshape back to the original size to undo the splitting into heads we performed earlier. This is the same as concatenating the final vectors from each head. And that\u2019s it for multi-head attention! We\u2019ve gotten through the most intense part of our implementation.\n\nMLP\nThe next part of the architecture is the multilayer perception or MLP. This is a fancy way of saying 2 stacked linear layers. There\u2019s not much to be said here, it is a standard neural network.\n\nclass MLP(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.c_fc = nn.Linear(n_emb, 4 * n_emb)\n        self.gelu = nn.GELU()\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(4 * n_emb, n_emb)\n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        x = self.gelu(self.c_fc(x))\n        x = self.c_proj(x)\n        x = self.dropout(x)\n        return x\nWe take the input and project it to a higher dimension with c_fc . Then we apply gelu nonlinearity and project it back down to the embedding dimension with c_proj . Finally, we apply dropout and return. The purpose of the MLP is to allow for some computation after the vectors have communicated during attention. We will stack these communication layers (attention) and computation layers (mlp) into a block.\n\nBlock\nA GPT block consists of attention followed by an MLP. These blocks will be repeated to make the architecture deep.\n\nclass Block(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.mlp = MLP()\n        self.mha = MultiHeadAttention()\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        x = self.mha(x)\n        x = self.mlp(x)\n        return x\nNow, we need to add two more features to improve training stability. Let\u2019s take a look at the architecture diagram again.\n\nLayernorms and Skip Connections\n\nimage by author\nWe still need to implement the components highlighted in red. The arrows are skip connections. Instead of the input being transformed directly, the effect of the attention and MLP layers is additive. Their result is added to the input instead of directly replacing it. This is good for the training stability of deep networks since in the backward pass, the operands of an addition operation will receive the same gradient as their sum. Gradients can thus flow backwards freely which prevents issues like vanishing\/exploding gradients that plague deep networks. Layernorm also helps with training stability by ensuring activations are normally distributed. Here is the final implementation.\n\nclass Block(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.mlp = MLP()\n        self.mha = MultiHeadAttention()\n        self.ln_1 = nn.LayerNorm(dims=n_emb)\n        self.ln_2 = nn.LayerNorm(dims=n_emb)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        x = x + self.mha(self.ln_1(x))\n        x = x + self.mlp(self.ln_2(x))\n        return x\nLayernorm is applied before multi-head attention and MLP. The skip connections are added with x = x + ... making the operations additive.\n\nForward Pass\nWith the Block defined, we can finish the full GPT-2 forward pass.\n\nn_layers = 3 # put at top of file\nclass GPT(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.wte = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_emb) # token embeddings\n        self.wpe = nn.Embedding(ctx_len, n_emb) # position embeddings\n        self.blocks = nn.Sequential(\n            *[Block() for _ in range(n_layers)],\n        ) # transformer blocks\n        self.ln_f = nn.LayerNorm(dims=n_emb) # final layernorm\n        self.lm_head = nn.Linear(n_emb, vocab_size) # output projection\n    # Tensor shapes commented\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T = x.shape # (B = batch_size, T = ctx_len)\n        tok_emb = self.wte(x) # (B, T, n_emb)\n        pos_emb = self.wpe(mx.arange(T)) # (T, n_emb)\n        x = tok_emb + pos_emb # (B, T, n_emb)\n        x = self.blocks(x) # (B, T, n_emb)\n        x = self.ln_f(x) # (B, T, b_emb)\n        logits = self.lm_head(x) # (B, T, vocab_size)\n        return logits\nWe create a container for the blocks using nn.Sequential which takes any input and passes it sequentially through the contained layers. Then we can apply all the blocks with self.blocks(x) . Finally, we apply a layer norm and then the lm_head. The lm_head or language modeling head is just a linear layer that maps from the embedding dimension to the vocab size. The model will output a vector containing some value for each word in our vocabulary, or the logits. We can softmax the logits to get a probability distribution over the vocabulary which we can sample from to get the next token. We will also use the logits to calculate the loss during training. There are just two more things we need to implement before we begin training.\n\nSampling\nWe need to write a generate function to sample from the model once training is complete. The idea is that we start with some sequence of our choice, then we predict the next token and append this to our sequence. Then we feed the new sequence in and predict the next token again. This continues until we decide to stop.\n\n# method of GPT class\ndef generate(self, max_new_tokens):\n  ctx = mx.zeros((1, 1), dtype=mx.int32)\nWe prompt the model with a single token, zero. Zero is the newline character so it is a natural place to start the generation since we just want to see how Shakespeare-like our model can get. Note that we initialize the shape to (1, 1) to simulate a single batch with a sequence length of one.\n\n# method of GPT class\ndef generate(self, max_new_tokens):\n  ctx = mx.zeros((1, 1), dtype=mx.int32)\n  for _ in range(max_new_tokens):\n    logits = self(ctx[:, -ctx_len:]) # pass in last ctx_len characters\n    logits = logits[:, -1, :] # get logits for the next token\n    next_tok = mx.random.categorical(logits, num_samples=1)\n    ctx = mx.concatenate((ctx, next_tok), axis=1)\nreturn ctx\nThen we get the logits for the next token by passing in the last ctx_len characters to the model. However, our model output is of shape (B, T, vocab_size) since it predicts the next token logits for each token in the input. We use all of that during training, but now we only want the logits for the last token because we can use this to sample a new token. Therefore we index the logits to get the last element in the first dimension which is the sequence dimension. Then we sample the next token using the mx.random.categorical() function which takes the logits and the number of samples we want as input. This function will softmax the logits to turn them into a probability distribution and then randomly sample a token according to the probabilities. Finally, we concatenate the new token to the context and repeat the process max_new_tokens number of times.\n\nInitialization\nThe last thing to do is handle weight initialization which is important for training dynamics.\n\n# method of GPT\ndef _init_parameters(self):\n    normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)\n    residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 \/ math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))\nFirst, we define two different nn.init.normal functions. The first one is for initializing all linear and embedding layers. The second one is for initializing linear layers that are specifically residual projections i.e. the last linear layer inside multi-head attention and MLP. The reason for this special initialization is that it checks accumulation along the residual path as model depth increases according to the GPT-2 paper [2].\n\nIn mlx we can change the parameters of the model using the mx.update() function. Checking the docs, it expects a complete or partial dictionary of the new model parameters. We can see what this dictionary looks like by printing out self.parameters() inside the GPT class.\n\n{'wte': {'weight': array([[-0.025084, -0.0197523, -0.0341617, ..., -0.0979123, -0.0830218, -0.0784692],\n       [-0.00777913, -0.117002, -0.0310708, ..., 0.0128591, 0.122941, 0.000414443],\n       [0.0240044, -0.0859084, 0.0253116, ..., 0.108967, 0.0767123, 0.0221565],\n       ...,\n       [0.050729, -0.04578, 0.0685943, ..., -0.0496998, -0.00350879, -0.00631825],\n       [0.00518804, 0.0499818, 0.0330045, ..., 0.0300661, 0.0431054, 0.000958906],\n       [-0.0323007, 0.0132046, 0.0208218, ..., -0.0785159, 0.00436121, -0.00726994]], dtype=float32)}, 'wpe': {'weight': array([[0.000797923, -0.0396898, -0.029047, ..., -0.0132273, 0.00684483, -0.0067624],\n       [-0.0247021, -0.0274349, 0.0310587, ..., -0.100099, 0.0301566, -0.0178732],\n       [0.0929172, -0.0468649, 0.0101506, ..., -0.0341086, -0.0516283, 0.0447596],\n       ...,\n       [-0.0508172, 0.0892201, -0.00183612, ..., -0.00341944, 0.023437, 0.0296461],\n       [0.0105829, 0.0688093, 0.146744, ..., -0.0836337, 0.0206679, 0.0184166],\n       [-0.00578717, -0.0606196, -0.0917056, ..., -0.0641549, -0.0490424, 0.0998114]], dtype=float32)}, 'blocks': {'layers': [{'mlp': {'c_fc': {'weight': array([[0.0169199, 0.00264431, 0.0316978, ..., -0.0596867, -0.0153549, 0.0176386],\n       ...\nIt\u2019s a nested dictionary containing each model weight as an mx.array. So to initialize the parameters of our model we need to build up a dictionary like this with our new params and pass them to self.update() . We can achieve this as follows:\n\n# method of GPT\ndef _init_parameters(self):\n    normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)\n    residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 \/ math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))\n    new_params = []\n    for name, module in self.named_modules():\n        if isinstance(module, nn.layers.linear.Linear):\n            new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))\n        elif isinstance(module, nn.layers.embedding.Embedding):\n            new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)\nWe maintain a list of tuples called new_params which will contain tuples of (parameter_name, new_value). Next, we loop through each nn.Module object in our model with self.named_modules() which returns tuples of (name, module). If we print out the module names within the loop we see that they look like this:\n\nlm_head\nblocks\nblocks.layers.4\nblocks.layers.3\nblocks.layers.3.ln_2\nblocks.layers.3.ln_1\nblocks.layers.3.mha\nblocks.layers.3.mha.resid_dropout\nblocks.layers.3.mha.c_proj\nblocks.layers.3.mha.attn_dropout\nblocks.layers.3.mha.c_attn\n...\nblocks.layers.0.mlp.dropout\nblocks.layers.0.mlp.c_proj\nblocks.layers.0.mlp.gelu\nblocks.layers.0.mlp.c_fc\nwpe\nwte\nWe use the isinstance() function to find the linear and embedding layers and then add them to our list. For example, say we are looping and reach \u201cblocks.layers.0.mlp.c_fc\u201d which is the first linear layer in the MLP. This would trigger the first if statement, and the tuple (\"block.layers.0.mlp.c_fc.weight\", [<normally initialized weight here>]) would be added to our list. We have to add \u201c.weight\u201d to the name because we specifically want to initialize the weight in this way, not the bias. Now we need to handle the residual projection initialization.\n\n# method of GPT\ndef _init_parameters(self):\n    normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)\n    residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 \/ math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))\n    new_params = []\n    for name, module in self.named_modules():\n        if isinstance(module, nn.layers.linear.Linear):\n            if 'c_proj' in name: # residual projection\n                new_params.append((name + '.weight', residual_init(module.weight)))\n            else:\n                new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))\n        elif isinstance(module, nn.layers.embedding.Embedding):\n            new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))\nAfter checking if the module is a linear layer, we check if \u201cc_proj\u201d is in the name because that\u2019s how we named the residual projections. Then we can apply the special initialization. Finally, we need to initialize the biases to be zero.\n\n# method of GPT\ndef _init_parameters(self):\n    normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)\n    residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 \/ math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))\n    new_params = []\n    for name, module in self.named_modules():\n        if isinstance(module, nn.layers.linear.Linear):\n            if 'c_proj' in name:\n                new_params.append((name + '.weight', residual_init(module.weight)))\n            else:\n                new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))\n            if 'bias' in module:\n                new_params.append((name + '.bias', mx.zeros(module.bias.shape)))\n        elif isinstance(module, nn.layers.embedding.Embedding):\n            new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))\n    self = self.update(utils.tree_unflatten(new_params))\nWe add another if statement under our linear branch to check if the nn.Module object has a bias attribute. If it does, we add it to the list initialized to zeros. Finally, we need to transform our list of tuples into a nested dictionary. Luckily mlx has some functions implemented for dealing with parameter dictionaries, and we can use util.tree_unflatten() to convert this list of tuples to a nested parameter dictionary. This is passed into the update method to initialize the parameters. Now we can call _init_parameters() in the constructor.\n\nclass GPT(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.wte = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_emb) # token embeddings\n        self.wpe = nn.Embedding(ctx_len, n_emb) # position embeddings\n        self.blocks = nn.Sequential(\n            *[Block() for _ in range(n_layers)],\n        ) # transformer blocks\n        self.ln_f = nn.LayerNorm(dims=n_emb) # final layernorm\n        self.lm_head = nn.Linear(n_emb, vocab_size) # output projection\n        self._init_parameters() # <-- initialize params\n        # print total number of params on initialization\n        total_params = sum([p.size for n,p in utils.tree_flatten(self.parameters())])\n        print(f\"Total params: {(total_params \/ 1e6):.3f}M\")\n    # Tensor shapes commented\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T = x.shape # (B = batch_size, T = ctx_len)\n        tok_emb = self.wte(x) # (B, T, n_emb)\n        pos_emb = self.wpe(mx.arange(T)) # (T, n_emb)\n        x = tok_emb + pos_emb # (B, T, n_emb)\n        x = self.blocks(x) # (B, T, n_emb)\n        x = self.ln_f(x) # (B, T, b_emb)\n        logits = self.lm_head(x) # (B, T, vocab_size)\n        return logits\n    def generate(self, max_new_tokens):\n        ctx = mx.zeros((1, 1), dtype=mx.int32)\n        for _ in range(max_new_tokens):\n          logits = self(ctx[:, -ctx_len:]) # pass in last ctx_len characters\n          logits = logits[:, -1, :] # get logits for the next token\n          next_tok = mx.random.categorical(logits, num_samples=1)\n          ctx = mx.concatenate((ctx, next_tok), axis=1)\n        return ctx\n    def _init_parameters(self):\n        normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)\n        residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 \/ math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))\n        new_params = []\n        for name, module in self.named_modules():\n            if isinstance(module, nn.layers.linear.Linear):\n                if 'c_proj' in name:\n                    new_params.append((name + '.weight', residual_init(module.weight)))\n                else:\n                    new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))\n                if 'bias' in module:\n                    new_params.append((name + '.bias', mx.zeros(module.bias.shape)))\n            elif isinstance(module, nn.layers.embedding.Embedding):\n                new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))\n        self = self.update(utils.tree_unflatten(new_params))\n\nWe also add 2 lines of code in the constructor to print the total number of params. Finally, we are ready to build the training loop.\n\nTraining Loop\nTo train the model we need a loss function. Since we are predicting classes (next token) we use cross-entropy loss.\n\ndef loss_fn(model, x, y):\n    logits = model(x)\n    B, T, C = logits.shape # (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size)\n    logits = logits.reshape(B*T, C)\n    y = y.reshape(B*T)\n    loss = nn.losses.cross_entropy(logits, y, reduction='mean')\n    return loss\nFirst, we get the logits from the model. Then we reshape logits to make a list of vocab_size length arrays. We also reshape y, the correct token ids, to have the same length. Then we use the built-in cross-entropy loss function to calculate the loss for each example and average them to get a single value.\n\nmodel = GPT()\nmx.eval(model.parameters()) # Create the model params (mlx is lazy evaluation)\nloss_and_grad = nn.value_and_grad(model, loss_fn)\nlr = 0.1\noptimizer = optim.AdamW(learning_rate=lr)\nNext, we instantiate the model, but since mlx is lazy evaluation it won\u2019t allocate and create the parameters. We need to call mx.eval on the parameters to ensure they get created. Then we can use nn.value_and_grad() to get a function that returns the loss and gradient of model parameters w.r.t the loss. This is all we need to optimize. Finally, we initialize an AdamW optimizer.\n\nA quick note on nn.value_and_grad(). If you are used to PyTorch you might expect us to use loss.backward() which goes through the computation graph and updates the .grad attribute of each tensor in our model. However, mlx automatic differentiation works on functions instead of computation graphs [3]. Therefore, mlx has built-ins that take in a function and return the gradient function such as nn.value_and_grad() .\n\nNow we define the training loop.\n\nnum_epochs=20\nbatch_size=32\nfor epoch in range(num_epochs):\n    model.train(True)\n    running_loss = 0\n    batch_cnt = 0\n    for input, label in get_batches(X_train, y_train, batch_size):\n        batch_cnt += 1\n        loss, grads = loss_and_grad(model, input, label)\n        optimizer.update(model, grads)\n        running_loss += loss.item()\n        # compute new parameters and optimizer state\n        mx.eval(model.parameters(), optimizer.state)\n    avg_train_loss = running_loss \/ batch_cnt\n    model.train(False) # set eval mode\n    running_loss = 0\n    batch_cnt = 0\n    for input, label in get_batches(X_val, y_val, batch_size):\n        batch_cnt += 1\n        loss = loss_fn(model, input, label)\n        running_loss += loss.item()\n    avg_val_loss = running_loss \/ batch_cnt\n    print(f\"Epoch {epoch:2} | train = {avg_train_loss:.4f} | val = {avg_val_loss:.4f}\")\nThe outer loop runs through the epochs. We first set the model to training mode because some modules have different behaviors during training and testing such as dropout. Then we use our get_batches function from earlier to loop through batches of the training data. We get the loss over the batch and the gradient using loss_and_grad . Then we pass the model and gradients to the optimizer to update the model parameters. Finally we call mx.eval (remember mlx does lazy evaluation) to ensure the parameters and optimizer state get updated. Then we calculate the average train loss over the data to print later. This is one pass through the training data. Similarly, we calculate the validation loss and then print the average train and val loss over the epoch.\n\ncompletion = decode(model.generate(1000)[0].tolist())\nprint(completion)\nwith open('completions.txt', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(completion)\nFinally, we add some code to generate from our model. Since the generation output is still in the (B, T) shape we have to index it at 0 to make it 1D and then convert it from an mlx array to a Python list. Then we can pass it to our decode function from earlier, and write it to a file.\n\nThese are the parameters we will use for training (you can play around with this):\n\nctx_len = 128\nn_emb = 128\ndropout = 0.1\nhead_size = 128\nn_heads = 4\nn_layers = 3\nnum_epochs = 20\nbatch_size = 64\nlr = 1e-3\nNow we can run the file to start training. With the settings above training took around 10 minutes on my m2 MacBook. I achieved the following training loss last epoch.\n\nEpoch 19 | train = 1.6961 | val = 1.8143\nLet\u2019s look at some output.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nBut accomes mo move it.\n\nKING EDWARD:\nWhere our that proclaim that I curse, or I sprithe.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nNot want:\nHis bops to thy father\nAt with hath folk; by son and fproathead:\nThe good nor may prosperson like it not,\nWhat, the beggares\nMore hath, when that made a,\nYour vainst Citizen:\nLet here are go in queen me and knife\nTo my deserved me you promise: not a fettimes,\nThat one the will not.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nAnd been of queens,\nThou to do we best!\n\nJULIET:\nNot, brother recourable this doth our accuse\nInto fight!\nNot bad for just 10 minutes of training with a tiny model that is predicting characters!

{"document_index":14,"context":"My eyes felt like galaxies\u2014holding the swirling glow of countless memories\u2014as I took in our childhood home. Its siding looked like remnants of driftwood after a bonfire. I swore I smelled the smoky char of pine creep into my nostrils. It\u2019s wild how the past stays with you like that. It can feel more visceral and real than the tangible things right in front of you.\n\n\u201cJesus, it feels like just yesterday.\u201d I placed a trembling hand over my heart, struggling to steady my breath.\n\nMy brother, Perry, pulled me into a tight embrace, his strength grounding me like an anchor.\n\n\u201cThe house hasn\u2019t changed much,\u201d he said, his voice steady and comforting. \u201cBut we have.\u201d His certainty made me question, Have I really changed?\n\nBetween the two of us, Perry was as solid and stoic as a mountain range. Good thing, because I was like the wind\u2014flighty and unpredictable. Over the years, Perry had learned to handle even my harshest hurricanes.\n\nBeing his older sister\u2014even if only by four minutes\u2014I always wished I\u2019d been his protector rather than the other way around. But that demon burning deep in my belly also flashed a crooked smile, knowing that Perry would never abandon me, especially since I got sober.\n\nI hadn\u2019t had a drink in exactly seven hundred and thirty days, and although it remained unsaid, I knew Perry was terrified of leaving me to my own devices in fear I would relapse.\n\nOur sibling bond was iron-clad. After we lost our parents in the fire (my mother didn\u2019t properly butt out her 2:00 am cigarette and well, the rest is history), all Perry and I had was each other. But let\u2019s call a spade a spade; we were also as fucked up and as co-dependent as it gets. Who mutually decides to visit the catalyst of your alcohol addiction on the anniversary of your sobriety?\n\nThe house\u2019s dilapidated front door creaked as Perry gently pushed it open. The rusted metal hinges were holding it up by a thread.\n\n\u201cAfter you.\u201d Perry gestured me in, squinting from the sunlight. He was a gentleman, even in such obscurity.\n\nAs he held the door open, the shallow scar on his right cheek taunted me like some kind of schoolyard bully. His wound often pulled me in like that. Some days, I was sure I would dive right into it and drown. Other days, I prayed to God and the Devil himself to just let me fucking drown, already.\n\nThat mark became permanently etched on Perry\u2019s face on the day I quit drinking, exactly seven hundred and thirty days ago. That was the day Perry screamed bloody murder at me from the passenger seat, \u201cJackie! Stop the fucking car!\u201d But my bloodstream was far too poisoned with Bacardi Limon to listen. All I remember next was my vehicle being wrapped around a tree. I could have died that day, but what truly disturbed me in the middle of the night was the fact that I almost killed Perry.\n\nA lot can happen in seven hundred and thirty days. But I assure you, forgiving yourself isn\u2019t one of them.\n\n\u201cWell? You coming in?\u201d Perry was still holding the door ajar.\n\nI shook it off and gave my brother a knowing glance. I swear, even though we were fraternal, we had twin telepathy. I exhaled and walked in.\n\n\u201cWatch your step,\u201d I warned, my forehead tense.\n\nI imagined the rickety floorboards collapsing, crashing us into what had once been our dad\u2019s \u201cman cave\u201d. That\u2019s where he was passed out, the night of the fire.\n\n\u201cKids, stay here. Do not move,\u201d our mother demanded after getting us out of the house safely. I remember the black soot on her face and the spiderweb veins in her eyes. She shook us firmly by the forearms. \u201cI\u2019m getting your father.\u201d\n\nPerry and I held each other, shaking. The heat from the inferno felt like standing in a volcano. We never saw our parents again.\n\nTwo decades later, there we were\u2014Perry and I\u2014-making our way through the wreckage of our home. It was midday, yet the inside of the house screamed a tone of pale blue midnight. My shoulders were up to my ears, as though we were walking through a haunted house attraction.\n\nI coughed into my forearm. The ocean of dust was thick like butter. As I cleared my lungs, Perry called out from behind me.\n\n\u201cJacks, look at this! The fireplace,\u201d Perry's voice was filled with awe.\n\n\u201cUnbelievable. It\u2019s still here,\u201d I whispered, a lump forming in my throat.\n\nIt was as though a Fairy Godmother breezed by and brought the decaying living room to life with her magical paintbrush. Kind of like in \u201cTitanic\u201d, when they showed the sunken ship underwater, versus in its prestige as it sailed across the Atlantic.\n\nWe made our way over to the fireplace and sat cross-legged on the floor.\n\n\u201cThis was our favorite spot, remember?\u201d I avoided his gaze, overwhelmed by the flood of memories.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Perry murmured, his eyes softening with nostalgia.\n\nFor a moment, the taste of crispy, fire roasted marshmallows superseded the saturated stench of mildew.\n\n\u201cRemember our s\u2019mores nights?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cDuh. What about all our fireplace movie nights?\u201d Perry proceeded to do his best, nasally, childhood impersonation of me, \u201cBut mom! I want to watch Beauty and the Beast!! Perry always gets to pick the movie!!\u201d\n\nI punched him in the arm, \u201cFirst of all, I never sounded like that. And second. So what? I knew what I wanted.\u201d\n\nThe corners of Perry\u2019s mouth lifted. He had such a sincere sparkle about him, as though a storm cloud of confetti followed him overhead wherever he went, \u201cYou really did, kiddo.\u201d\n\nMy chest went heavy. How could Perry love me after everything I had done? After all the relationships I\u2019d ruined? All the jobs I\u2019d lost? All of his relationships I\u2019d ruined? How could he still choose me, when so often I had chosen a forty of Jack Daniels over him?\n\nHow could Perry still love me after I almost fucking killed him?\n\nPerry\u2019s gaze widened, \u201cHey! Remember when Mom would bring out those hot drinks she always made?\u201d He paused, almost as if he was searching for the right term. \u201cApple\u2026 something? Apple ssshhh\u2026\u201d\n\nI snapped my fingers, \u201cApple-Schnapple!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, looking back it was basically just hot apple cider, but damn it was good.\u201d And it really was.\n\nOur laughs echoed throughout the abandoned asylum we once called home.\n\nPerry leaned back, holding himself up with his hands. \u201cI loved our fireplace hangs. Especially our movie nights down here. But nothing beats our movies up in the projector room.\u201d\n\nI tilted my head, \u201cWe never had a projector room.\u201d\n\nPerry playfully \u201cshoo\u2019d\u201d me away.\n\n\u201cNo. Perry. I would remember us having a projector room. Our movie nights together were our favorite thing. You even just said it yourself.\u201d\n\nThe house suddenly became pin-drop silent as Perry leaned in. \"Memories are quite something, aren\u2019t they?\" The slight shift in his tone made my skin crawl. Perry was always wistful, but this felt different, almost\u2026 clinical, \"We often remember things in ways that are\u2026 easier for us to digest.\"\n\nI was fidgety. \u201cGees Perry. You sound like Dr. Lasko.\u201d\n\nHe seemed to enjoy my little joke.\n\nDr. Lasko had been my therapist since the accident, and I would go out on a limb and say that he would not have approved of this self-inflicted exposure therapy I was subjecting myself to by visiting the house.\n\nPerry seemingly snapped out of his little therapist moment and went right back to being his sparkly confetti self. As I watched his amicable face scan the mantle above the fireplace, I felt a sickening uneasiness. Imagine you had actually fucking killed him.\n\n\u201cMan, I can still picture all our family photos up there,\u201d Perry\u2019s childlike wonder destroyed me.\n\nMy face went flush. I could feel the water rising in my eyes like the tides. How pathetic and infuriating was it that after everything I\u2019d done, I was still somehow the victim.\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d He took my hand.\n\n\u201cOh Perry,\u201d  I threw myself into him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nMy brother held me with his usual care that I didn\u2019t deserve.\n\n\u201cJacks, it\u2019s ok. I\u2019m still here. We\u2019re both still here.\u201d\n\nAs my chin rested on my brother\u2019s shoulder, I looked ahead of me at the remains of the house. Something felt off, and it wasn\u2019t just the overall unsettling environment. My brow furrowed. \u201cWasn\u2019t the doorway to the kitchen on the other side of the living room?\u201d\n\nI felt Perry shrug, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nI was staring into the out of place doorway like I was trying to pull a recollection towards me. And that\u2019s when I saw them in the kitchen: the translucent memory of mom and dad. Mom was getting our Apple-Schnapples ready. She was pacing, unlike Dad, who was sitting motionless at the table. His face was planted on its mahogany surface. His glass of Apple-Schnapple was empty, and so was the bottle of Jim Beam beside it.\n\nMom floated into the living room, our warm beverages in hand and a cigarette in her mouth, \u201cKids, your father\u2019s not feeling well. Let\u2019s have our Apple-Schnapples in here.\u201d\n\nOh my God. The bruise on her face.\n\nPerry jarred me back to reality with the gut punch of what he had to say next, \u201cYou\u2019re remembering the truth about mom and dad, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI pushed myself off and away from him. \u201cHow did you\u2026\u201d\n\nMy brother looked down, delicately tracing the floor with his finger, \u201cWe always put them on a pedestal after they died.\u201d\n\nI felt a shiver run down my spine, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\nAs Perry continued to speak, his words grew even more detached. \"Do you remember that first drink Dad ever gave you?\"\n\nMy eyes darted around the room as my jugular pulsed in my neck. As much as I tried to escape what Perry had just said, I did remember.\n\nI could hear my dad\u2019s slurring words of encouragement, \u201cCome on, Jackie. Just one drink. It\u2019ll be our special time, just you and me.\u201d\n\nThe bitterness of that first sip of beer made me squirm, but sharing a \u201cspecial time\u201d with my dad\u2014and the desperate yearning that maybe he did love me, afterall\u2014was the overwhelm of the full moon swallowing me whole. I was only a child, and much like how my mom turned a blind eye to my father\u2019s drinking, she did the exact same when it came to her daughter.\n\nI\u2019d used the death of my parents as the excuse for my alcoholism for so long, because admitting that they helped create the monster I would eventually become was like a knife to the heart. And knowing I had been too weak to conquer the addiction from my own volition just made the weapon twist in my chest.\n\nThe room was spinning. My face was blistering hot like the night of the fire. Or was that the warm heat from the fireplace when we were kids? The childhood fireplace memories ran through my mind, frame by frame, until\u2026..they eventually vaporized to nothing. I crouched over, thinking I might vomit.\n\n\u201cWe never had a fireplace.\u201d Perry was nodding, very matter-of-factly.\n\nMy fingernails dug into my thighs when I looked at the fireplace and: it was gone. Only a blank wall of faded, forest green wallpaper remained. Our house was once on fire, yes, but that was it. There was never a happy childhood fireplace. Ever.\n\nMy hands were cold and clammy. I fell back onto the wall behind me. \u201cPerry. Where are we?\u201d\n\nHe stood up and glided towards the staircase. One hand on the banister, his footsteps creaked, one by one, as he made his way to the second floor.\n\nMy mouth was bone dry, \u201cPerry!\u201d\n\nHe stopped and turned towards me, \u201cCome to the projector room. We love watching movies together, don\u2019t we? There\u2019s a movie I\u2019d like to show you.\u201d\n\nAs my brother disappeared from sight, I did what any classic horror movie trope would tell you to do: I went upstairs.\n\nI found Perry standing at the end of the ominous hallway. Large, empty picture frames lined the oxblood walls leading up to him. Through the doorway where Perry stood, particles in the air danced in the projector\u2019s cone-shaped light. That telltale winding of a film reel was the only sound in the deafening quiet of this house that I no longer recognized.\n\nHalf of Perry\u2019s face\u2014the one with the scar\u2014was perfectly illuminated, as though he was wearing the mask from \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera\u201d. \u201cI think you\u2019re ready to see how this movie ends, Jackie. This is the most progress you\u2019ve made since we\u2019ve been coming here.\u201d\n\nI gripped my thumbs in the palms of my hands, \u201cPerry, you\u2019re freaking the fuck out of me!\u201d\n\nI thought my knees might buckle as my brother\u2019s face glitched, like a flash of static snow on a television set. As his face settled back to normal to a deadpan gaze, he disappeared in the innocuous room. I followed, running on nothing but fumes.\n\nClutching the doorway, my mouth fell agape. Perry was gone. I darted to the middle of the room.\n\nAs I frantically searched for my brother, I shielded my eyes with the back of my hand from the projector\u2019s light. And that\u2019s when, from behind me, I heard five words that made my blood run cold, \u201cJackie! Stop the fucking car!\u201d\n\nI was convulsing yet paralyzed. Moving as slowly as cold molasses, I rotated on the spot towards my worst nightmare, shown on 35 mm. On the projector screen was Perry and me in my car, exactly seven hundred and thirty days ago, the day I almost kill\u2014\n\nOh my God.\n\nMy head pounded as fragmented memories surged. The reality of what happened began to crystallize, unrelenting.\n\nMy joints ached and my stomach churned. Clamping a hand over my mouth to stifle a scream, I stumbled down the hallway as it began caving in on itself. The picture frames were sucked into the walls. The floorboards cracked into distorted peaks and valleys. Wooden beams swung down from the ceiling like pendulums. I tried to spit out the chalky grit of disintegrating drywall that made the hallway look like a winter squall.\n\nPanting heavily, I stopped dead in my tracks at the stained glass window. My body trembled with an all-too-familiar dread. Each time I faced this, I wondered if this fall would be the one that would finally end it all.\n\nMaybe it\u2019d be better if it did.\n\nHolding my breath, I threw myself through the glass, my hands clawing the air for dear life. Free falling two stories feels like an eternity when you\u2019re watching the memory of your childhood home fall apart before your very eyes. But when the weight of my body finally made contact with the earth I\u2014\n\nI gasped. The cold air of the hospital room shocked my lungs. I sat up, ripping the suction cups from my face and body. My gown was clinging to me, soaked in sweat. Medical equipment beeped all around me like a metronome.\n\nDr. Lasko, my therapist since the accident, sat across the stark white room, sighing as he rubbed his forehead. He, too, was connected to a plethora of suction cups and wires. He looked a little worn out in the fluorescent overhead lighting. Ever since I was hospitalized and later incarcerated, Dr. Lasko had been helping me delve into my memories, namely the ones that were too excruciating for me to face. And as such, Dr. Lasko had been appearing in the simulations as my brother Perry, the love of my life who died in the car crash, seven hundred and thirty days prior.\n\nDisoriented, I blinked rapidly, the vividness of the memory contrasting sharply with the sterile, geometric ceiling tiles above me.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to do that again!\u201d I was venomous.\n\n\u201cJackie,\u201d Dr. Lasko started.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d I pulled up four fingers for air quotes, \u201c\u2018Jackie, don\u2019t give up. This was the closest you\u2019ve ever come to facing the truth.\u201d\n\nAs the initial burst of adrenal and cortisol left my body, I fell back on my pillow. I was depleted. Quiet rivers flowed down my cheeks.\n\nRemoving his own suction cups, Dr. Lasko approached my bedside and took a seat. He treaded lightly. \u201cJackie, I understand how challenging this is for you, but you did an incredible job today.

{"document_index":8,"context":"so into northern spain!\nour magical urban-plus-outdoor-adventure itinerary\nCAROLINE CHAMBERS\nMAY 29, 2024\n\nI recently returned from a trip to Northern Spain with two of my best friends, Lily and Nellie, sponsored by elsewhere, a travel company that works with local experts to create truly unique travel experiences.\n\nOn our last day in Spain, we had an incredible private tour of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and then partook in our favorite trip ritual: hopping around from pintxo bar to pintxo bar (pintxos = small little plates of food \u2014 similar to tapas but they are typically sitting on the bar and you point to what you want), drinking txakoli (a lightly effervescent white wine that is very, very popular in the region), and playing gin rummy.\n\nWe then headed back to our hotel room, crammed onto the bed with, well, another bottle of txakoli, and recorded what I can only assume was the greatest podcast episode of all time. We recapped the full trip, what we loved, what we would change. We shared the most absurd moments. We laughed so hard and made so much fun of each other in a way that only really old friends who have just spent 12 days straight together can do. I\u2019ve been so excited to share it.\n\nBut\u2026 the recording failed. I have no idea what happened, but I blame the txakoli.\n\nI thought about re-recording with them remotely, but the magic of that moment, being there together on the last night of a truly perfect trip, is gone. So instead, I\u2019ll share the highlights here! Full itinerary with ALL the details is here.\n\n\nWe spent two nights in Madrid and could have spent at least four. There\u2019s so much to see and do here, and we barely scratched the surface. Our highlights were shopping in the Chueca and Salamanca neighborhoods \u2014 Malababa, Soeur, and Sess\u00f9n were some of our favorite shops. We had a wonderful meal at Charr\u00faa Madrid and fun cocktails at Ficus Bar. You can find all of our favorite shops, tapas bars, and many places that we didn\u2019t get to explore but wanted to on my Spain map here.\n\n\nstrolling the charming, windy streets of chueca!\n\nSan Sebasti\u00e1n is the coolest town \u2014 worth a trip to Spain all on its own. It\u2019s a coastal town on the Northern coast of Spain, right next to the French border, and it fully charmed us. It\u2019s that perfect European blend of old meets new \u2014 hip young surfers going to 200-year-old pintxo bars to meet up with their friends after surfing all afternoon, 100-year-old pastry shops next door to chic Spanish design ateliers. We spent three nights there and loved every minute, but these were our highlights:\n\ncooking in a private gastronomic club\nWhen you\u2019re wandering the cobblestone streets of San Sebasti\u00e1n looking for your next pintxo, you might find yourself stumbling through the doorway of a friendly looking restaurant, only to be turned away. \u201cDisculpa, privado!\u201d they\u2019ll tell you \u2014 \u201cSorry, private!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve stumbled into a sociedad gastron\u00f3mica \u2014 one of San Sebasti\u00e1n\u2019s 100+ private gastronomic clubs. Each one has its own personality and offering, but at its core is this: it\u2019s a private social club centered around cooking and eating with fellow members. Members reserve a time to cook \u2014 depending on the size of the club, three to four members can cook at a time \u2014 and they can invite guests to join them. Members will head to one of the many local markets, grab their food, and then bring it back to the shared kitchen to cook for\/with their friends and family.\n\n\npost-lunch txakoli on the deck at the club\nThe only hitch? You have to be with a member to go inside of one! This was the coolest tour that elsewhere set up for us \u2014 Jani, our guide, was an incredibly cool young mom and entrepreneur (she owns her own tour company) and is a member of several clubs. She picked us up at our hotel, took us to her favorite local market and farmer\u2019s market to grab ingredients, and then back to her club, which was a stone building with wooden beams and felt like a scene out of a Game of Thrones banquet. We cooked a local fish dish, a tomato salad, and seared white asparagus, and she taught us all about Basque cuisine and the local gastronomic clubs.\n\nWe spent the entire afternoon cooking and eating and drinking txakoli on the deck of her club overlooking the city. A cannot miss experience if you find yourself in San Seb! Here\u2019s a great Saveur article if you want to read more about the clubs.\n\npintxo hopping\nPick three or four pintxos bars that are close together, and hop from bar to bar, eating a snack and having a glass of txakoli at each one. This is always my favorite way to explore a new place on limited time \u2014 an appetizer at one spot, a meal at another, after-dinner drinks at a third, so the pintxos culture really allows you to see a lot of places in one night!\n\nMy map has a lot of great pintxos bars saved, but here\u2019s an especially great hop (these are all on my map):\n\nStart at Ganbara and grab whatever looks good \u2014 we had delightful fried padr\u00f3n peppers.\n\nWalk over to Txepetxa Taberna for a little sandwich \u2014 my favorites were the simple ones filled with local j\u00e1mon and idiaz\u00e1bal cheese (similar to manchego).\n\nThe cheesy risotto at Borda Berri was phenomenal.\n\nFinish your night at Otaegui, the oldest bakery in the city, for pantxineta, a delightful puff pastry and custard-filled local treat, and a slice of Basque cheesecake.\n\n\npintxo hopping around the old town!\nsurfing\nNellie is a big surfer and after a full 24 hours of pestering, finally convinced me to go out with her. There are tons of surf shops that rent wetsuits and boards lining the beach, so it was really easy to get into the water. The waves were absolutely perfect. Gentle, clear water, no getting-stuck-in-a-washing-machine vibes when you fall of your board. It was so, so much fun.\n\n\n\nMy favorite part of the trip was our four days on the camino. The Camino de Santiago, also known as the Way of Saint James, is a well-trod pilgrimage route that traverses Spain, culminating at the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. The camino has origins back to the medieval era and has four routes connecting different parts of Spain to Galicia. The routes consist of trails, modern roads, and original medieval stone pathways\u2026\n\n\nthat pass through everything from modern city to medieval village\u2026\n\n\nto small fishing town\u2026\n\n\nto stunning wilderness landscapes.\n\n\nThe flysch was truly breathtaking. If you wind up in San Sabasti\u00e1n and want to walk just one day of the camino, walk from Orio to Zumaia, all the way out past the town to see the flysch, then sleep at Hotel Iturregi that night!\nThe Camino Franc\u00e9s is the most popular route, but my friends and I did a small portion of the Camino Norte, which San Sebasti\u00e1n is right on. The Norte is challenging and stunningly beautiful, with steep, rugged terrain, but with plenty of stopping places for pintxos and a glass of wine along the way. It\u2019s hard to sum up what a wonderful experience hiking it was.\n\nWe originally wanted to hike directly from one location to the next \u2014 to hike from one hotel to the next without ever getting in a car \u2014 15 to 20 miles per day on the camino. However, the hotels along the route are rustic, more rustic than we were up for, so we wound up switching to stay at a gorgeous hotel in a txakoli vineyard, and just took cabs to and from the camino for our last two days.\n\nHiking the camino was a bucket list experience \u2014 we hiked through fishing villages and past a truly breathtaking flysch rock formation, a cult tried to recruit us by beckoning us in with warm tea and cake, we talked about everything, we talked about nothing, we laughed so hard it hurt. I cannot wait to get back to the camino one day.\n\n\nBilbao was an excellent urban re-introduction at the end of four days on the camino. We really didn\u2019t know what to expect, and we were pleasantly surprised. I wouldn\u2019t make a trip to Spain specifically for Bilbao, but I\u2019d certainly make an effort to visit if I was in Northern Spain.\n\nThe Guggenheim alone could occupy an entire day \u2014 it\u2019s a massive collection of modern and contemporary art. The architecture itself is reason alone to visit. We loved touring the museum with a private tour guide who regaled us with detailed information about every single piece.\n\n\nWe strolled along the river from the Guggenheim all the way to the seven streets area, where we bopped between shops and pintxo bars for the rest of the day. Admittedly, we enjoyed a lot of Italian food in Bilbao as we were feeling a little burnt out on Basque food by this point in the trip. No shame in dabbling in a little pizza while in Spain! You\u2019ll find lots of Basque and Italian recs on my map!\n\nAfter two nights in Bilbao, we headed home. It was a truly magical trip that we\u2019ll still be laughing and reminiscing about when we\u2019re old ladies.\n\n\n\nI love electrolyte powders but so many brands have a lot of sodium in them, which can make me feel really bloated. Ultima is lower-sodium and the flavors are great!\n\nLily had a lanyard strap iPhone case that I was really jealous of. Kind of dorky looking but who cares, it was so convenient to have her phone handy for photos and looking up directions!\n\nI will never stop yappin\u2019 about my Owala water bottle. Having the ability to drink out of the straw or tilt it and chug it never gets old!\n\nI brought disposable cameras for each of us and I can\u2019t wait to get the film back!! Mattis saw them and has been begging me to get him one \u2014 it would be fun to give your kids a disposable camera to capture a summer trip!\n\n\n\nPan-fried dover sole with buttery tomato sauce and corn risotto. The reviews on this week\u2019s recipe are RAVING! It really is so good and fancy feeling. You have to make this one ASAP, especially if you travel somewhere with access to great fish this summer!\n\nSunshine curry was a cult fave last summer \u2014 of yours and of mine! I love making a huge batch and eating it for lunch all week long (a perk of the fact that my kids won\u2019t touch it, though I know many kids love this one!).\n\nMy summer tomato galette is the stuff of summer produce dreams. Buy a store-bought pie crust to make it even easier, but it\u2019s worth making the crust from scratch if you have 15 extra minutes! PS: Make the boursin summer squash galette while you\u2019re at it. Two summery galettes + a simple salad of romaine tossed with salt, pepper, really good extra-virgin olive oil, and balsamic, with shaved Parm, and chopped almonds would be such a chic little meal.\n\nChicken panzanella is one of my all-time faves. Crisp croutons, juicy tomatoes, perfectly cooked chicken, balsamic, olive oil, basil, with big hunks of melty goat cheese. It\u2019s the perfect summer lunch or dinner! Don\u2019t let your croutons burn!\n\n\nI loved reading about all of your happy places in the comments of last week\u2019s post! My number one takeaway is that I need to spend more time in Maine \u2014 so many of your happy places are there! Including this week\u2019s winner, Heather.\n\n\nDreamy! And now you can bring your new pair of Lake Pajamas to Boothbay Harbor this summer! Email me your size and address!\n\nDo you have any Spain recs to add? Anyone taking an exciting trip this summer? We\u2019re staying local for most of the summer so that we can enjoy our new cabin, minus our annual two-week Southern voyage to DeBordieu, SC to visit George\u2019s family and Bald Head Island, NC to visit mine!","query":"Where was I offered desserts?","ground_truth":"You ate a delightful puff pastry and custard-filled local treat, and a slice of Basque cheesecake at Otaegui, and you were beckoned with cake in the camino.","response_correct":"You enjoyed pantxineta and Basque cheesecake at Otaegui and were offered cake on the Camino.","response_wrong":"You were treated to a chocolate mousse and churros at the Guggenheim."}
{"document_index":1,"context":"---The Paths through the Underground\/Underdark---(9 days of travel)\nWandering through the dark tunnels, the rushing sounds of the underground river begin to fade as it diverges from the cavern. You walk on for miles, the smell of hard water and wet earth.

Seeking the next burrowed entrance left by the Kryn...\n---ENCOUNTER \u2013 Ropers x 2---\nDay 3 goes without issue...sleep.\n\nDay 4 - Kobold Trap\nPart way into the journey, the path becomes a protracted tunnel, snaking through the rock for hours without end. Eventually, you begin to notice other smaller tunnels intersecting with the burrowed canal. They appear partially ruined by this fresher tunnel, many of them now filled or partially collapsed.\n\nThey are no more than 2-3 feet wide, and numerous (dozens).\n\nIn some of the rubble, you can find broken tools... a hammer, some soiled leather, a knife.\n\nThe tunnel finally seems to open into a small 15-foot high, 30ft long chamber of dirt and rock, where a rather rancid smell lingers. Glancing within, a handful of the smaller tunnels seem to intersect with it, and whomever enters first (if not Cad), their leg is SNARED by a noose and they must make a Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 15) or be lifted into the air to dangle from a small trap (restrained, DC 16 to escape). The snare also drags a cable tied to numerous pans and metal scraps, making a ruckus!\n\nChattering and tiny warcrys begin to fill the tunnel from all sides... as dozens of small kobolds rush into the room, and from behind!\n\n-ENCOUNTER: Kobolds x 26, Kobold Inventor x 1-\n\u201cLoud food!
