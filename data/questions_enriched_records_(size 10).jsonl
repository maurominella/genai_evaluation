Light is their weapon\u2014and their safe haven \u2014 against the darkness they face. Trapped in a sinister horror story where there are only victims and monsters, can they break out to be the heroes they need to be? Quote2\n\u2015 Epic Games Store page description\nPlot\nSee also: Alan Wake, Alan Wake's American Nightmare, and Control\nIn 2023, thirteen years after the events of Alan Wake, a naked man emerges from the dark shores of Cauldron Lake, experiencing visions of a man violently screaming before he is found and has his heart cut out by a group of men wearing deer masks.\n\nFBI Special Agent Saga Anderson and her partner Alex Casey are dispatched to the town of Bright Falls, Washington to investigate a series of ritualistic murders. They investigate the latest victim, the naked man, who is revealed as former FBI Agent Robert Nightingale. It is believed he was murdered by a group calling themselves the \"Cult of the Tree\". In addition to Nightingale's corpse, Saga finds a mysterious manuscript page that seems to predict the future. While in the town, they encounter Sheriff Tim Breaker, who promises to assist their investigation, as well as waitress Rose Marigold, who recognizes Saga and acts like Saga was a local of the area, despite this being her first visit to the town. She also claims Saga's daughter Logan drowned several years ago, despite being alive in Virginia with her father. At the morgue, Saga then performs an autopsy on Nightingale's corpse, but it suddenly reanimates, in search of the \"Clicker\", and escapes the morgue after Breaker mysteriously vanishes.\n\nAs they pursue Nightingale to Cauldron Lake, Saga uses her psychic powers to investigate the scene. Casey reveals he had investigated a murder cult in New York City dedicated to bringing back the missing author Alan Wake by reenacting the murders described in his books, and that Nightingale came to Bright Falls to pursue Alan thirteen years prior. Saga encounters Nightingale, now converted into what the manuscript called a \"Taken\", and is forced to kill him. Saga then finds a very-shaken Alan Wake washed up on the shore of the lake and takes him into custody while also discovering evidence that an organization called the Federal Bureau of Control has a presence in Bright Falls. Saga and Casey take Alan back to the Elderwood Palace Lodge in their field office where he recounts how he escaped from a dream-like dimension called the Dark Place.\n\nWhile trapped in the Dark Place, Alan continually tried to find a way to escape. After appearing in a mysterious talk show called \"In Between With Mr. Door\", Alan found an Angel Lamp once belonging to Thomas Zane and connected to the Clicker that, in combination with his writing ability, allowed him to manipulate the Dark Place to better navigate it. Alan began navigating a dark, twisted version of New York City, following the trail of Alex Casey's investigation of the \"Cult of the Word\" led by Alan's evil doppelganger Scratch, who survived his erasure from existence, which brought him through the various scenes of the murders committed by the cult. Along the way, Alan also encountered Breaker, who was searching for the talk show host, Warlin Door, believing him to be responsible for trapping him in the Dark Place. Alan also occasionally made brief contact with Saga, the two of them trading vital information when they could. After believing he had killed Tom Zane, who had gone insane from his captivity inside the Dark Place, Alan was contacted by an alternative version of himself, explaining that his repeated attempts to escape the Dark Place are causing him to experience time loops.\n\nBack in the present, Alan explains that he wrote a new novel, \"Return\", that helped him escape the Dark Place. However, Scratch re-edited the manuscript into a horror story now taking effect in reality. Alan warns that Scratch is searching for the Clicker, which is the key he needs to free the malevolent Dark Presence completely, but also the key to permanently defeating it. When one of the manuscript pages mentioning the Cult of the Tree possesses the Clicker, Saga decides to follow its trail in Watery and realizes that \"Return\" has rewritten her past so that her daughter Logan drowned in an accident. Angered that Alan wrote her and Logan into his story, Saga recovers the Clicker, but before she can get it to Alan, agents from the FBC led by Agent Kiran Estevez arrive and apprehend him as well as the Cult leaders, revealed to be town entrepreneurs Ilmo and Jaakko Koskela.\n\nWith no other options, Saga goes to the Valhalla Nursing Home and tracks down Odin and Tor Anderson, who know more about the Clicker. As she communicates with them and rescues Tor from a Taken Cynthia Weaver, she learns that Odin and Tor are actually her grand-uncle and grandfather, respectively, and she inherited their seer abilities, allowing her to discern the changes to reality \"Return\" is causing. Odin and Tor also explain that the Clicker does not do anything by itself, but instead dramatically enhances the creative power of the person using it, which is why it is important to Alan and Scratch. Saga then heads back to Bright Falls to get the Clicker to Alan, but finds out that the Alan who escaped Cauldron Lake was actually Scratch. With his identity now exposed, Scratch kills Jaakko and escapes from captivity, attempting to take the Clicker from Saga. He is temporarily thwarted and banished by the FBC.\n\nIlmo reveals that he and Jakko formed the cult in order to scare townsfolk away from the dangers of the lake, while they perform their ritual killings on whatever Taken emerges from it, such as Nightingale. Realizing that Alan is still trapped in the Dark Place, Saga enlists the help of Casey, Odin, Tor, and Estevez to carry out a ritual to summon him to the real world. Meanwhile, Alan continues to try and find a way out of the Dark Place, eventually making his way to his old apartment. There, he discovers his wife Alice had been tormented with visions of Scratch, eventually leading to her apparent suicide. In anger, Alan kills who he believes is Scratch, but is actually a version of himself attempting to fix Scratch's ending of \"Return\", perpetuating the loop.\n\nBack in the real world, the summoning ritual fails to summon Alan in the current time and instead was responsible for his initial appearance earlier in the story. Both Saga and Alan come to the realization that Alan and Scratch were always the same person, with Scratch being Alan, who is possessed by the Dark Presence at the end of every loop, and thus indirectly responsible for Alice's death. Scratch arrives at the summoning site and Saga is able to banish him from Alan's body, only for Scratch to possess Casey instead, steal the Clicker, and throw Saga into the Dark Place.\n\nWith Scratch in possession of the Clicker, Alan concludes that the only way to stop him now is to find the manuscript and write a completely new ending for \"Return\". He returns to his writing room and tries to work out how to write a perfect ending that saves everybody while staying consistent with the horror genre. Meanwhile, trapped in her mind place, Saga fights off the Dark Presence's attempt to overwhelm her with her own negative emotions and self-doubt. Now in the Dark Place proper, she reunites with Breaker, who remains there in his search for Door, heavily implied to be Saga's missing father. She then receives aid from an anonymous woman who directs her to the Clicker and a Bullet of Light. Saga takes the two items and escapes back to the real world by mimicking Door's actions on a manuscript page given to her by Breaker. With the Clicker, Alan is able to banish Scratch from Casey's body. Scratch returns to possessing Alan, and Saga shoots him with the Bullet of Light, seemingly killing him and Scratch. As Casey recovers from his possession, Saga tries to call Logan to confirm her safety, but the scene cuts short before any answer can be heard.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, a recording left behind by Alice reveals that she had managed to fully regain her memories of what happened to Alan after consulting with the FBC at the Oldest House. She had tricked Alan into thinking she committed suicide by choosing to return the Dark Place as part of a plan to help him eventually escape, explaining that the only way he can escape the loops is through \"ascension.\" Alan then revives from his gunshot wound and says, \"It's not a loop, it's a spiral.\"\n\nIn the \"Final Draft\" ending, Alan realizes that the Bullet of Light was meant to cleanse a part of himself the Dark Presence used to create Scratch, finally killing his doppelg\u00e4nger for good while finishing the spiral and freeing Alan from the loop. Saga's call connects, confirming Logan's survival, and Alan revives soon after to the surprise of her and Casey, declaring himself the master of not just two worlds, but many.\n\nChapter List\nThe chapters\/parts listed here are played in the following order:\nPrologue: The Cult\nReturn 1: Invitation\nReturn 2: The Heart\nInitiation 1: Late Night\nInitiation 2: Casey\nInitiation 3: Haunting\nPlayers have the choice to play the following of Alan and Saga's chronological chapters\/parts in any order they wish:\nReturn 3: Local Girl\nReturn 4: No Chance\nReturn 5: Old Gods\nReturn 6: Scratch\nInitiation 4: We Sing\nInitiation 5: Room 665\nInitiation 6: Return\nInitiation 7: Masks\nInitiation 8: Zane's Film\nThe chapters\/parts listed here are past the point of no return and are played in the following order:\nReturn 7: Summoning\nInitiation 9: Gone\nReturn 8: Deerfest\nReturn 9: Come Home\nThe Final Draft\nRemedy released a New Game Plus update to the game on December 11th, 2023 named \"The Final Draft\".\n\nExpansion 1: Night Springs\nSet as \"episodes\" of the Night Springs TV show, these can be played in any order the player wishes.\n\nNumber One Fan\nNorth Star\nTime Breaker\nGameplay\nSimilar to the original, the game is a third-person shooter, with players using light to burn away the darkness of the enemy and various weapons to fight against the dark forces as well as various cult members. Unlike the first game, which was an action-adventure game, Alan Wake 2 emphasizes survival-horror gameplay. Players have an inventory with limited space, where they will need to conserve their ammo and healing items. Health items themselves consist of med kits and painkillers, with Safe Havens only healing the player to take them out of a \"critical state.\" Players also encounter various puzzles and locked boxes that they'll need to solve in order to obtain upgraded gear.\n\nThe game features two distinct campaigns, one where you play as the titular Alan Wake, and one where you play a new protagonist, Saga Anderson. The two campaigns blend together, eventually allowing you to switch between the two at various points, using a dark puddle found in certain Break Rooms if the player wishes, with the two stories both foreshadowing and echoing each other. Eventually though, the player will be required to complete both stories before progressing past a point of no return.\n\nSaga\u2019s story takes place in the Pacific Northwest, consisting of three hubs: the small town of Bright Falls, the stunning primordial forest surrounding the mysterious Cauldron Lake, and the run-down town of Watery. Alan's story takes place solely within the Dark Place in a warped version of New York City, with his reality shifting and looping. Similarly to the episodic nature of the original, the narrative is divided into chapters, which each having their own accompanying end song. Between chapters, players are returned to the hubs and are allowed to explore or move to the next chapter at their own pace.\n\nWhilst Saga's story involves a lot of talking to various townsfolk around the area in order to progress in her environment, Alan uses an Angel Lamp to allow him to change a scene by transferring light from one area of New York to another. Both characters have their own \"mind palaces\" to help progress their stories, with Alan having his Writer's Room to help change the story and Saga having her Mind Place to help her with her investigations, both of which can be accessed at the press of a button.\n\nDevelopment\nInitial development\nThroughout 2011 and 2012, several hints had been dropped of a potential sequel to Alan Wake. These hints include when \"Alan Wake 2\" was shown on the Artist Althea Suarez Gata's CV, only for it to be removed on the very same day. Whilst Alan Wake's American Nightmare (though the name was unknown at the time) was revealed not long after this hiccup, fans had been trying to find more evidence of a direct sequel. In Alan Wake's American Nightmare, the credits to the game also then indicated that \"Alan Wake's journey through the night will continue\".\n\nAlso in 2012, Sam Lake tweeted a link to a \"Blogspot\" called \"This House of Dreams.\" At first, the site seemed like a mere blog for someone refurbishing a house, but one such blog talks about a dream the blogger had about a man \"wearing a funny jacket with old-fashioned elbow patches\" and that he wanted \"to turn all the lights on.\" This tweet came just days before E3 2012, a gaming expo that reveals and shows brand new content of upcoming releases. People also found that the domain \"alanwake2.com\" was also reserved by Remedy Entertainment.\n\nAt the Xbox Event on May 21, 2013, Remedy revealed Quantum Break, which would be an exclusive to the newest Xbox console at the time, Xbox One. On February 2016, it was confirmed that it would also come to PC. Fans were disappointed that Alan Wake 2 wasn't revealed, but some still supported Remedy in their new franchise. A day after the Quantum Break announcement, Sam Lake took to YouTube to talk to the fans about why Alan Wake 2 wasn't announced. He revealed that the time just wasn't right yet, but mentioned he had not given up on the franchise.\n\nIn April 2015, Remedy announced that Alan Wake 2 had previously gone into the early stage of development shortly after Alan Wake was released, where a video of prototype demo was also released. While in the stage of showing this demo to publishers, Remedy went into conversations with Microsoft and the project was put on hold indefinitely while Quantum Break went into development. The sequel would have introduced new features, many of which were used in Alan Wake's American Nightmare. When asked about the possibility of an Alan Wake sequel being released in the future, Sam Lake replied, \"It's hard to guess,\" but that he would \"love to do that\".\n\nRemedy Connected Universe\nEaster eggs in Remedy's 2019 game Control revealed that the game shared the same universe as Alan Wake. Two typewritten pages found within the game (and which were said to have been written by Alan Wake himself) heavily imply that almost ten years had passed since Alan's experience in Bright Falls, and that it was not an isolated event, but rather what the Federal Bureau of Control classifies as an \"Altered World Event\" (AWE). In this way, Control revealed additional information about the events involving the Dark Presence, especially given the nature of its own primary enemy, the Hiss.\n\nFurthermore, the second DLC for Control, AWE, was released in August 2020. While the letters can simply stand for \"Altered World Event,\" they also resemble Alan's own name. In addition to this, the top half of the cover art depicted a flashlight-wielding person in a dark forest, while the bottom half depicted a second figure surrounded by red, which figures prominently with the Hiss in Control.\n\nIn an interview given on May 14, 2020 with VG24\/7, Sam Lake commented on this, explaining, \"Through AWE you\u2019ll learn more about the Bureau\u2019s involvement, research, and interest in Alan Wake and the events that took place 10 years ago,\u201d Lake said. \u201cWe\u2019re really happy to give fans of the original game a bit more of Alan Wake-related content.\"[1] This suggested a deeper connection, possibly even a future crossover, between the events of Control and Alan Wake.\n\nThe plot of AWE confirmed this, tying up some loose ends from the previous Alan Wake entries while also setting up details which would come in a sequel work. In the ending of AWE, an alarm sounds in the Federal Bureau of Control that another AWE appears to be happening again in Bright Falls. This, along with Alan's narration, seemed to indicate Remedy's next game could be a follow up to Alan Wake.\n\nOfficial development\nIn March 2020, Remedy signed a deal with Epic Games to publish two single-player games under Epic's new publishing initiative. The games were said to be part of \"the same franchise\". In March 2021, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala confirmed that they were indeed working on two unannounced project with Epic Games that are part of the same franchise, one smaller scale and one AAA in size. In April 2021, GamesBeat reporter Jeff Grubb told viewers that \"I've heard that Remedy is going to be making Alan Wake 2,\" as part of the Remedy-Epic deal. Grubb went on to say that the game \"should kind of be the follow-up that fans of that series want,\" but that there's little extra information and no word on an official announcement.\n\nOn the 7 September 2021, Alan Wake Remastered was revealed by Sam Lake, of which some people believed to have been the smaller project mentioned in March 2021, and the other AAA from the same franchise was to be Alan Wake 2. With the reveal of Alan Wake Remastered, which indicated Remedy are trying to generate interest in the franchise, a sequel was looking more and more likely.\n\nAt The Game Awards 2021, Alan Wake 2 was officially announced for 2023 and would be Remedy's first survival-horror video game. Like Quantum Break and Control, it was announced that Alan Wake 2 would use the Northlight engine and be a third-person game. On a later interview with IGN, Sam Lake revealed that the game would have a Mature 17+ age rating.\n\nOn May 24, 2023, Sony hosted a PlayStation Showcase livestream, in which a gameplay trailer for Alan Wake 2 was revealed, with a release date of October 17, 2023. It was revealed that players would control two protagonists within their own campaigns, Alan Wake himself and a new protagonist, Saga Anderson. At Summer Game Fest on June 8, 2023, Sam Lake shared further information on the ways Alan and Saga's campaigns would be connected to each other. Additionally, more gameplay and combat mechanics were shown.\n\nOn August 17, 2023, the game was delayed by 10 days to October 27, 2023 to make way for various other games also releasing in October. At Gamescom 2023, Alan Wake's side of the game in the Dark Place was focused on in a new trailer, which was later followed by a lengthy Alan-centric gameplay featured behind closed doors.\n\nReception\nAlan Wake 2 received near universal acclaim from video game critics. Itr received five nominations at the 2023 Golden Joystick Awards and won the Critic's Choice Award. It was nominated for eight awards at The Game Awards 2023, and won for Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, and Best Art Direction.\n\nThe game went on to win more awards in Finland and around the world.\n\nTrivia\nIlkka Villi and Matthew Porretta both reprise their role as Alan Wake in the sequel. James McCaffrey reprises his role as Alex Casey, who he previously voiced in the manuscript pages of The Sudden Stop.\nBrett Madden, who played Alice Wake in the first game, sadly passed away in September 2020. She was memorialized in the credits of the game. Alice was recast in the sequel, now played by Christina Cole.\nWhile the first game was an action-adventure game that implemented horror elements, Alan Wake 2 is a full-blown survival-horror game.\nUnlike the first game that was published by Microsoft Studios, the sequel is published by Epic Games Publishing.\nThe game was initially a digital-only release due to various shifts towards a digital-only market. This was also done to keep the price of the game down at launch. However despite initially saying there were no plans for a physical release, in June 2024 along with a trailer and release date announcement of the first DLC it was revealed that a physical version would be released that October, a year after the digital release. Both a physical version of the digital deluxe version (inclusive of the DLC) and a limited run collector's edition were announced.\nThe second entry in Remedy's Max Payne series, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, also had two playable protagonists (Max Payne and Mona Sax).","query":"What is Alan tricked into believing by his wife?","ground_truth":"Alan believes that while being possessed by the Dark Presence, he torments Alice with visions of his alter ego, Scratch, which eventually leading to her suicide.

{"document_index":8,"context":"so into northern spain!\nour magical urban-plus-outdoor-adventure itinerary\nCAROLINE CHAMBERS\nMAY 29, 2024\n\nI recently returned from a trip to Northern Spain with two of my best friends, Lily and Nellie, sponsored by elsewhere, a travel company that works with local experts to create truly unique travel experiences.\n\nOn our last day in Spain, we had an incredible private tour of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and then partook in our favorite trip ritual: hopping around from pintxo bar to pintxo bar (pintxos = small little plates of food \u2014 similar to tapas but they are typically sitting on the bar and you point to what you want), drinking txakoli (a lightly effervescent white wine that is very, very popular in the region), and playing gin rummy.\n\nWe then headed back to our hotel room, crammed onto the bed with, well, another bottle of txakoli, and recorded what I can only assume was the greatest podcast episode of all time. We recapped the full trip, what we loved, what we would change. We shared the most absurd moments. We laughed so hard and made so much fun of each other in a way that only really old friends who have just spent 12 days straight together can do. I\u2019ve been so excited to share it.\n\nBut\u2026 the recording failed. I have no idea what happened, but I blame the txakoli.\n\nI thought about re-recording with them remotely, but the magic of that moment, being there together on the last night of a truly perfect trip, is gone. So instead, I\u2019ll share the highlights here! Full itinerary with ALL the details is here.\n\n\nWe spent two nights in Madrid and could have spent at least four. There\u2019s so much to see and do here, and we barely scratched the surface. Our highlights were shopping in the Chueca and Salamanca neighborhoods \u2014 Malababa, Soeur, and Sess\u00f9n were some of our favorite shops. We had a wonderful meal at Charr\u00faa Madrid and fun cocktails at Ficus Bar. You can find all of our favorite shops, tapas bars, and many places that we didn\u2019t get to explore but wanted to on my Spain map here.\n\n\nstrolling the charming, windy streets of chueca!\n\nSan Sebasti\u00e1n is the coolest town \u2014 worth a trip to Spain all on its own. It\u2019s a coastal town on the Northern coast of Spain, right next to the French border, and it fully charmed us. It\u2019s that perfect European blend of old meets new \u2014 hip young surfers going to 200-year-old pintxo bars to meet up with their friends after surfing all afternoon, 100-year-old pastry shops next door to chic Spanish design ateliers. We spent three nights there and loved every minute, but these were our highlights:\n\ncooking in a private gastronomic club\nWhen you\u2019re wandering the cobblestone streets of San Sebasti\u00e1n looking for your next pintxo, you might find yourself stumbling through the doorway of a friendly looking restaurant, only to be turned away. \u201cDisculpa, privado!\u201d they\u2019ll tell you \u2014 \u201cSorry, private!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve stumbled into a sociedad gastron\u00f3mica \u2014 one of San Sebasti\u00e1n\u2019s 100+ private gastronomic clubs. Each one has its own personality and offering, but at its core is this: it\u2019s a private social club centered around cooking and eating with fellow members. Members reserve a time to cook \u2014 depending on the size of the club, three to four members can cook at a time \u2014 and they can invite guests to join them. Members will head to one of the many local markets, grab their food, and then bring it back to the shared kitchen to cook for\/with their friends and family.\n\n\npost-lunch txakoli on the deck at the club\nThe only hitch? You have to be with a member to go inside of one! This was the coolest tour that elsewhere set up for us \u2014 Jani, our guide, was an incredibly cool young mom and entrepreneur (she owns her own tour company) and is a member of several clubs. She picked us up at our hotel, took us to her favorite local market and farmer\u2019s market to grab ingredients, and then back to her club, which was a stone building with wooden beams and felt like a scene out of a Game of Thrones banquet. We cooked a local fish dish, a tomato salad, and seared white asparagus, and she taught us all about Basque cuisine and the local gastronomic clubs.\n\nWe spent the entire afternoon cooking and eating and drinking txakoli on the deck of her club overlooking the city. A cannot miss experience if you find yourself in San Seb! Here\u2019s a great Saveur article if you want to read more about the clubs.\n\npintxo hopping\nPick three or four pintxos bars that are close together, and hop from bar to bar, eating a snack and having a glass of txakoli at each one. This is always my favorite way to explore a new place on limited time \u2014 an appetizer at one spot, a meal at another, after-dinner drinks at a third, so the pintxos culture really allows you to see a lot of places in one night!\n\nMy map has a lot of great pintxos bars saved, but here\u2019s an especially great hop (these are all on my map):\n\nStart at Ganbara and grab whatever looks good \u2014 we had delightful fried padr\u00f3n peppers.\n\nWalk over to Txepetxa Taberna for a little sandwich \u2014 my favorites were the simple ones filled with local j\u00e1mon and idiaz\u00e1bal cheese (similar to manchego).\n\nThe cheesy risotto at Borda Berri was phenomenal.\n\nFinish your night at Otaegui, the oldest bakery in the city, for pantxineta, a delightful puff pastry and custard-filled local treat, and a slice of Basque cheesecake.\n\n\npintxo hopping around the old town!\nsurfing\nNellie is a big surfer and after a full 24 hours of pestering, finally convinced me to go out with her. There are tons of surf shops that rent wetsuits and boards lining the beach, so it was really easy to get into the water. The waves were absolutely perfect. Gentle, clear water, no getting-stuck-in-a-washing-machine vibes when you fall of your board. It was so, so much fun.\n\n\n\nMy favorite part of the trip was our four days on the camino. The Camino de Santiago, also known as the Way of Saint James, is a well-trod pilgrimage route that traverses Spain, culminating at the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. The camino has origins back to the medieval era and has four routes connecting different parts of Spain to Galicia. The routes consist of trails, modern roads, and original medieval stone pathways\u2026\n\n\nthat pass through everything from modern city to medieval village\u2026\n\n\nto small fishing town\u2026\n\n\nto stunning wilderness landscapes.\n\n\nThe flysch was truly breathtaking. If you wind up in San Sabasti\u00e1n and want to walk just one day of the camino, walk from Orio to Zumaia, all the way out past the town to see the flysch, then sleep at Hotel Iturregi that night!\nThe Camino Franc\u00e9s is the most popular route, but my friends and I did a small portion of the Camino Norte, which San Sebasti\u00e1n is right on. The Norte is challenging and stunningly beautiful, with steep, rugged terrain, but with plenty of stopping places for pintxos and a glass of wine along the way. It\u2019s hard to sum up what a wonderful experience hiking it was.\n\nWe originally wanted to hike directly from one location to the next \u2014 to hike from one hotel to the next without ever getting in a car \u2014 15 to 20 miles per day on the camino. However, the hotels along the route are rustic, more rustic than we were up for, so we wound up switching to stay at a gorgeous hotel in a txakoli vineyard, and just took cabs to and from the camino for our last two days.\n\nHiking the camino was a bucket list experience \u2014 we hiked through fishing villages and past a truly breathtaking flysch rock formation, a cult tried to recruit us by beckoning us in with warm tea and cake, we talked about everything, we talked about nothing, we laughed so hard it hurt. I cannot wait to get back to the camino one day.\n\n\nBilbao was an excellent urban re-introduction at the end of four days on the camino. We really didn\u2019t know what to expect, and we were pleasantly surprised. I wouldn\u2019t make a trip to Spain specifically for Bilbao, but I\u2019d certainly make an effort to visit if I was in Northern Spain.\n\nThe Guggenheim alone could occupy an entire day \u2014 it\u2019s a massive collection of modern and contemporary art. The architecture itself is reason alone to visit. We loved touring the museum with a private tour guide who regaled us with detailed information about every single piece.\n\n\nWe strolled along the river from the Guggenheim all the way to the seven streets area, where we bopped between shops and pintxo bars for the rest of the day. Admittedly, we enjoyed a lot of Italian food in Bilbao as we were feeling a little burnt out on Basque food by this point in the trip. No shame in dabbling in a little pizza while in Spain! You\u2019ll find lots of Basque and Italian recs on my map!\n\nAfter two nights in Bilbao, we headed home. It was a truly magical trip that we\u2019ll still be laughing and reminiscing about when we\u2019re old ladies.\n\n\n\nI love electrolyte powders but so many brands have a lot of sodium in them, which can make me feel really bloated. Ultima is lower-sodium and the flavors are great!\n\nLily had a lanyard strap iPhone case that I was really jealous of. Kind of dorky looking but who cares, it was so convenient to have her phone handy for photos and looking up directions!\n\nI will never stop yappin\u2019 about my Owala water bottle. Having the ability to drink out of the straw or tilt it and chug it never gets old!\n\nI brought disposable cameras for each of us and I can\u2019t wait to get the film back!! Mattis saw them and has been begging me to get him one \u2014 it would be fun to give your kids a disposable camera to capture a summer trip!\n\n\n\nPan-fried dover sole with buttery tomato sauce and corn risotto. The reviews on this week\u2019s recipe are RAVING! It really is so good and fancy feeling. You have to make this one ASAP, especially if you travel somewhere with access to great fish this summer!\n\nSunshine curry was a cult fave last summer \u2014 of yours and of mine! I love making a huge batch and eating it for lunch all week long (a perk of the fact that my kids won\u2019t touch it, though I know many kids love this one!).\n\nMy summer tomato galette is the stuff of summer produce dreams. Buy a store-bought pie crust to make it even easier, but it\u2019s worth making the crust from scratch if you have 15 extra minutes! PS: Make the boursin summer squash galette while you\u2019re at it. Two summery galettes + a simple salad of romaine tossed with salt, pepper, really good extra-virgin olive oil, and balsamic, with shaved Parm, and chopped almonds would be such a chic little meal.\n\nChicken panzanella is one of my all-time faves. Crisp croutons, juicy tomatoes, perfectly cooked chicken, balsamic, olive oil, basil, with big hunks of melty goat cheese. It\u2019s the perfect summer lunch or dinner! Don\u2019t let your croutons burn!\n\n\nI loved reading about all of your happy places in the comments of last week\u2019s post! My number one takeaway is that I need to spend more time in Maine \u2014 so many of your happy places are there! Including this week\u2019s winner, Heather.\n\n\nDreamy! And now you can bring your new pair of Lake Pajamas to Boothbay Harbor this summer! Email me your size and address!\n\nDo you have any Spain recs to add? Anyone taking an exciting trip this summer? We\u2019re staying local for most of the summer so that we can enjoy our new cabin, minus our annual two-week Southern voyage to DeBordieu, SC to visit George\u2019s family and Bald Head Island, NC to visit mine!","query":"What forms of exercise did we do?","ground_truth":"You did hiking and surfing.","response_correct":"You hiked and surfed.","response_wrong":"You did yoga and cycling."}

Tokenization is the process of mapping text to integers, which can be fed into the LLM. Our training corpus for this model will be the works of Shakespeare concatenated into one file. This is roughly 1 million characters and looks like this:\n\nFirst Citizen:\nBefore we proceed any further, hear me speak.\n\nAll:\nSpeak, speak.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nYou are all resolved rather to die than to famish?\n\nAll:\nResolved. resolved.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nFirst, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.\n...\nFirst, we read the file as a single long string into the text variable. Then we use the set() function to get all the unique characters in the text which will be our vocabulary. By printing vocab you can see all the characters in our vocabulary as one string, and we have a total of 65 characters which till be our tokens.\n\n# Creating the vocabulary\nwith open('input.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    text = f.read()\nvocab = sorted(list(set(text)))\nvocab_size = len(vocab)\n\nprint(''.join(vocab))\n# !$&',-.3:;?ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nprint(vocab_size)\n# 65\nProduction models will use tokenization algorithms like byte-pair encoding to generate a larger vocabulary of sub-word chunks. Since our focus today is on the architecture, we will continue with character-level tokenization. Next, we will map our vocabulary to integers known as token IDs. Then we can encode our text into tokens and decode them back to a string.\n\n# Create mapping from vocab to integers\nitos = {i:c for i,c in enumerate(vocab)} # int to string\nstoi = {c:i for i,c in enumerate(vocab)} # string to int\nencode = lambda x: [stoi[c] for c in x]\ndecode = lambda x: ''.join([itos[i] for i in x])\n\nprint(encode(\"hello world\"))\n# [46, 43, 50, 50, 53, 1, 61, 53, 56, 50, 42]\nprint(decode(encode(\"hello world\")))\n# hello world\nWe use theenumerate() function to iterate over all characters and their index in the vocabulary and create a dictionary itos which maps integers to characters and stoi which maps strings to integers. Then we use these mappings to create our encode and decode functions. Now we can encode the entire text and split training and validation data.\n\ndata = encode(text)\nsplit = int(0.9 * len(data))\ntrain_data = data[:split]\nval_data = data[split:]\nCurrently, our training data is just a very long string of tokens. However, we are trying to train our model to predict the next token some given previous tokens. Therefore our dataset should be comprised of examples where the input is some string of tokens and the label is the correct next token. We need to define a model parameter called context length which is the maximum number of tokens used to predict the next token. Our training examples will be the length of our context length.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the first ctx_len+1 tokens.\n\nctx_len = 8\nprint(train_data[:ctx_len + 1])\n# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47, 58]\n# x: [18, 47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47] | y: 58\nThis is one training example where the input is \u201c18, 47, 56, 57, 58, 1, 15, 47\u201d and the desired output is \u201c58\u201d. This is 8 tokens of context. However, we also want to train the model to predict the next token given only 7, 6, 5 \u2026 0 tokens as context which is needed during generation. Therefore we also consider the 8 sub examples packed into this example:\n\nctx_len = 8\nprint(train_data[:ctx_len + 1])\n# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47, 58]\n# 8 sub examples\n# [18] --> 47\n# [18, 47] --> 56\n# [18, 47, 56] --> 57\n# [18, 47, 56, 57] --> 58\n# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58] --> 1\n# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58, 1] --> 15\n# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58, 1, 15] --> 47\n# [18, 47, 56, 57, 58, 1, 15, 47] --> 58\nNotice that the labels are simply the inputs shifted left.\n\nprint(\"inputs: \", train_data[:ctx_len])\nprint(\"labels: \", train_data[1:ctx_len+1]) # labels = inputs indexed 1 higher\n# inputs: [18, 47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47]\n# labels: [47, 56, 57, 58,  1, 15, 47, 58]\nAt index 0 the input is 18 and the label is 47. At index 1 the input is everything before and including index 1 which is [18, 47] and the label is 56, etc. Now that we understand that the labels are simply the input sequence indexed one higher we can build our datasets.\n\n# Creating training and validation datasets\nctx_len = 8\nX_train = mx.array([train_data[i:i+ctx_len] for i in range(0, len(train_data) - ctx_len, ctx_len)])\ny_train = mx.array([train_data[i+1:i+ctx_len+1] for i in range(0, len(train_data) - ctx_len, ctx_len)])\nX_val = mx.array([val_data[i:i+ctx_len] for i in range(0, len(val_data) - ctx_len, ctx_len)])\ny_val = mx.array([val_data[i+1:i+ctx_len+1] for i in range(0, len(val_data) - ctx_len, ctx_len)])\nWe loop through the data and take chunks of size ctx_len as the inputs (X) and then take the same chunks but at 1 higher index as the labels (y). Then we take these Python lists and create mlx array objects from them. The model internals will be written with mlx so we want our inputs to be mlx arrays.\n\nOne more thing. During training we don\u2019t want to feed the model one example at a time, we want to feed it multiple examples in parallel for efficiency. This group of examples is called our batch, and the number of examples in a group is our batch size. Thus we define a function to generate batches for training.\n\ndef get_batches(X, y, b_size, shuffle=True):\n    if shuffle:\n        ix = np.arange(X.shape[0])\n        np.random.shuffle(ix)\n        ix = mx.array(ix)\n        X = X[ix]\n        y = y[ix]\n    for i in range(0, X.shape[0], b_size):\n        input = X[i:i+b_size]\n        label = y[i:i+b_size]\n        yield input, label\nIf shuffle=True, we shuffle the data by indexing it with a randomly shuffled index. Then we loop through our dataset and return batch-size chunks from input and label datasets. These chunks are known as mini-batches and are just stacked examples that we process in parallel. These mini-batches will be our input to the model during training.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of a minibatch of 4 examples with context length 8.\n\n\nA single minibatch (image by author)\nThis minibatch packs 32 next-token prediction problems. The model will predict the next token for each token in the input and the labels will be used to calculate the loss. Notice that the labels contain the next token for each index of the inputs.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to keep this picture in your mind because the shapes of these tensors will get hairy. For now, just remember that we will input a tensor of shape (batch_size, ctx_len) to the model.\n\nCoding GPT-2\nLet\u2019s look at the GPT-2 architecture to get an overview of what we are trying to implement.\n\n\nGPT-2 Architecture (image by author)\nDon\u2019t worry if this looks confusing. We will implement it step by step from bottom to top. Let\u2019s start by implementing the input embeddings.\n\nInput Embeddings\nThe purpose of the input embedding layer is to map token IDs to vectors. Each token will be mapped to a vector which will be its representation as it is forwarded through the model. The vectors for each token will accumulate and exchange information as they pass through the model and eventually be used to predict the next token. These vectors are called embeddings.\n\nThe simplest way to map token IDs to vectors is through a lookup table. We create a matrix of size (vocab_size, n_emb) where each row is the embedding vector for the corresponding token. This matrix is known as the embedding weights.\n\n\nEmbedding Layer (image by author)\nThe diagram shows an example embedding layer of size (65, 6). This means there are 65 tokens in the vocabulary and each one will be represented by a length 6 embedding vector. The inputted sequence will be used to index the embedding weights to get the vector corresponding to each token. Remember the minibatches we input into the model? Originally the minibatch is size (batch_size, ctx_len). After passing through the embedding layer it is size (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb). Instead of each token being a single integer, each token is now a vector of length n_emb.\n\nLet\u2019s define the embedding layer in code now.\n\nn_emb = 6 # You can add these hyperparams at the top of your file\nclass GPT(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.wte = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_emb)\nWe will define a class to organize our implementation. We subclass nn.Module to take advantage of mlx\u2019s features. Then in the init function, we call the superclass constructor and initialize our token embedding layer called wte .\n\nPositional Embeddings\nNext up is the positional embeddings. The purpose of positional embeddings is to encode information about the position of each token in the sequence. This can be added to our input embeddings to get a complete representation of each token that contains information about the token\u2019s position in the sequence.\n\nclass GPT(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.wte = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_emb) # token embeddings\n        self.wpe = nn.Embedding(ctx_len, n_emb) # position embeddings\nThe position embeddings work the same as token embeddings, except instead of having a row for each token we have a row for each possible position index. This means our embedding weights will be of shape (ctx_len, n_emb). Now we implement the __call__ function in our GPT class. This function will contain the forward pass of the model.\n\n# Tensor shapes commented\ndef __call__(self, x):\n    B, T = x.shape # (B = batch_size, T = ctx_len)\n    tok_emb = self.wte(x) # (B, T, n_emb)\n    pos_emb = self.wpe(mx.arange(T)) # (T, n_emb)\n    x = tok_emb + pos_emb # (B, T, n_emb)\nFirst, we break out the dimensions of our input into variables B and T for easy handling. In sequence modeling contexts B and T are usually used as shorthand for \u201cbatch\u201d and \u201ctime\u201d dimensions. In this case, the \u201ctime\u201d dimension of our sequence is the context length.\n\nNext, we calculate token and position embeddings. Notice that for the position embeddings, our input is mx.arange(T) . This will output an array of consecutive integers from 0 to T-1 which is exactly what we want because those are the positions we want to embed. After passing that through the embedding layer we will have a tensor of shape (T, n_emb) because the embedding layer plucks out the n_emb length vector for each of the T positions. Note that even though pos_emb is not the same shape as tok_emb we can add the two because mlx will broadcast, or replicate pos_emb across the batch dimension to allow elementwise addition. Finally, we perform the addition to get the new representations of the tokens with positional information.\n\nSelf-Attention\nSo far the representation vectors for each token have been calculated independently. They have not had the opportunity to exchange any information. This is intuitively bad in language modeling because the meaning and usage of words depend on the surrounding context. Self-attention is how we incorporate information from previous tokens into a given token.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s consider a naive approach. What if we simply represented each token as the average of its representation vector and the vectors of all the tokens before it? This achieves our goal of packing information from previous tokens into the representation for a given token. Here\u2019s what it would look like.\n\n\nimage by author\nBut self-attention doesn\u2019t involve writing a for-loop. The key insight is we can achieve this previous token averaging with matrix multiplication!\n\n\nimage by author\nBy multiplying our input sequence on the left by a special matrix we get the desired result. This matrix is known as the attention weights. Notice that each row of the attention weight matrix specificies \u201chow much\u201d of each other token goes into the representation for any given token. For example in row two, we have [0.5, 0.5, 0, 0]. This means that row two of the result will be 0.5*token1 + 0.5*token2 + 0*token3 + 0*token4 , or the average of token1 and token2. Note that the attention weights are a lower-triangular matrix (zeros in upper right entries). This ensures that future tokens will not be included in the representation of a given token. This ensures that tokens can only communicate with the previous tokens because during generation the model will only have access to previous tokens.\n\nLet\u2019s look at how we can construct the attention weight matrix.\n\n\nimage by author\nNotice that if we create an array of zeros with -inf in the upper right entries and then perform row-wise softmax we get the desired attention weights. A good exercise is to step through the softmax calculation for a row to see how this works. The takeaway is that we can take some array of size (ctx_len, ctx_len) and softmax each row to get attention weights that sum to one.\n\nNow we can leave the realm of naive self-attention. Instead of simply averaging previous tokens, we use arbitrary weighted sums over previous tokens. Notice what happens when we do row-wise softmax of an arbitrary matrix.\n\n\nimage by author\nWe still get weights that sum to one on each row. During training, we can learn the numbers in the matrix on the left which will specify how much each token goes into the representation for another token. This is how tokens pay \u201cattention\u201d to each other. But we still haven\u2019t understood where this matrix on the left came from. These pre-softmax attention weights are calculated from the tokens themselves, but indirectly through three linear projections.\n\nKeys, Queries, and Values\n\nimage by author\nEach token in our sequence emits 3 new vectors. These vectors are called keys, queries, and values. We use the dot product of the query vector of one token and the key vector of another token to quantify the \u201caffinity\u201d those two tokens have. We want to calculate the pairwise affinities of each token with every other token, therefore we multiply the query vector (4x3) with the key vector transposed (3x4) to get the raw attention weights (4x4). Due to the way matrix multiplication works the (i,j) entry in the raw attention weights will be the query of token i dot the key of token j or the \u201caffinity\u201d between the two. Thus we have calculated interactions between every token. However, we don\u2019t want past tokens interacting with future tokens so we apply a mask of -inf to the upper right entries to ensure they will zero out after softmax. Then we perform row-wise softmax to get the final attention weights. Instead of multiplying these weights directly with the input, we multiply them with the value projection. This results in the new representations.\n\nNow that we understand attention conceptually, let\u2019s implement it.\n\nclass Attention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, head_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.head_size = head_size\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n\nWe start by defining the key, query, and value projection layers. Note that instead of going from n_emb to n_emb, we project from n_emb to head_size. This doesn\u2019t change anything, it just means the new representations calculated by attention will be dimension head_size.\n\nclass Attention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, head_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.head_size = head_size\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n    def __call__(self, x): # shapes commented\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\nThe forward pass begins by calculating the key, query, and value projections. We also break out the input shape into the variables B, T, and C for future convenience.\n\nclass Attention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, head_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.head_size = head_size\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 2, 1])) \/ math.sqrt(self.head_size)\n        # attn_weights.shape = (B, T, T)\nNext, we calculate the attention weights. We only want to transpose the last two dimensions of the key tensor, because the batch dimension is just there so we can forward multiple training examples in parallel. The mlx transpose function expects the new order of the dimensions as input, so we pass it [0, 2, 1] to transpose the last two dimensions. One more thing: we scale the attention weights by the inverse square root of head_size. This is known as scaled attention and the purpose is to ensure that when Q and K are unit variance, attn_weights will be unit variance. If the variance of attn_weights is high, then the softmax will map these small and large values to 0 or 1which results in less complex representations.\n\nThe next step is to apply the mask to ensure we are doing causal language modeling i.e. ensuring tokens cannot attend to future tokens.\n\nclass Attention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, head_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.head_size = head_size\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)\n        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick\n        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 2, 1])) \/ math.sqrt(self.head_size)\n        # attn_weights.shape = (B, T, T)\nWe create the mask with a clever broadcasting trick. Let\u2019s say our ctx_len=4 like in the diagrams above. First, we use mx.arange(4) to set the indices variable to [0, 1, 2, 3].\n\n\nimage by author\nThen we can index like so indices[:, None] to generate a column vector with the values of indices. Similarly, we can get a row vector using indices[None]. Then when we do the < comparison, mlx broadcasts the vectors because they have mismatching shapes so they can\u2019t be compared elementwise. Broadcasting means mlx will replicate the vectors along the lacking dimension. This results in an elementwise comparison of two (4, 4) matrices which makes sense. Side note: I recommend familiarizing yourself with the details of broadcasting by reading this, it comes up all the time when dealing with tensors.\n\nAfter the elementwise comparison, we are left with the following tensor:\n\n[[False,  True,  True,  True],\n [False, False,  True,  True],\n [False, False, False,  True],\n [False, False, False, False]]\nMultiplying this tensor by -1e9, we get:\n\n[[-0e+00, -1e+09, -1e+09, -1e+09],\n [-0e+00, -0e+00, -1e+09, -1e+09],\n [-0e+00, -0e+00, -0e+00, -1e+09],\n [-0e+00, -0e+00, -0e+00, -0e+00]]\nNow we have an additive mask. We can add this matrix to our attention weights to make all the upper right entries very large negative numbers. This will cause them to be zeroed out after the softmax operation. Also, note that we add \u201c_\u201d as a prefix to the attribute name _causal_mask which marks it as a private variable. This signals to mlx that it is not a parameter and should not be updated during training.\n\nclass Attention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, head_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.head_size = head_size\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)\n        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick\n        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 2, 1])) \/ math.sqrt(self.head_size)\n        # attn_weights.shape = (B, T, T)\n        attn_weights = attn_weights + self._causal_mask\n        attn_weights = mx.softmax(attn_weights, axis=-1)\n        o = (attn_weights @ V) # (B, T, head_size)\nNow we can softmax row-wise to get the final attention weights and multiply these weights by the values to get our output. Note we pass axis=-1 to softmax which specifies that we want to softmax across the last dimension which are the rows.\n\nThe final step is output linear projection and dropout.\n\ndropout = 0.1 # add this with hyperparams at top of file\nclass Attention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, head_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.head_size = head_size\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)\n        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick\n        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(head_size, n_emb) # output projection\n        self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 2, 1])) \/ math.sqrt(self.head_size)\n        # attn_weights.shape = (B, T, T)\n        attn_weights = attn_weights + self._causal_mask\n        attn_weights = mx.softmax(attn_weights, axis=-1)\n        o = (attn_weights @ V) # (B, T, head_size)\n        o = self.c_proj(self.resid_dropout(o))\n        return o\nWe add two new layers, c_proj and resid_dropout which are the output projection and residual dropout. The output projection is to return the vectors to their original dimension n_emb. The dropout is added for regularization and training stability which is important as we start layering the transformer blocks to get a deep network. And that\u2019s it for implementing one attention head!\n\nMulti-Head Attention\nInstead of having just one attention head LLMs often use multiple attention heads in parallel and concatenate their outputs to create the final representation. For example, let\u2019s say we had one attention head with head_size=64 so the vector it produced for each token was 64 dimensional. We could achieve the same thing with 4 parallel attention heads each with head_size=16 by concatenating their outputs to produce a 16x4 = 64 dimensional output. Multi-head attention allows the model to learn more complex representations because each head learns different projections and attention weights.\n\nn_heads = 4\nclass MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module): # naive implementation\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.heads = [Attention(head_size \/\/ n_heads) for _ in range(n_heads)]\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        return mx.concatenate([head(x) for head in self.heads], axis=-1)\nThe straightforward implementation is to create a list of n_heads attention heads where each one has size equal to our final head size divided by n_heads. Then we concatenate the output of each head over the last axis. However, this implementation is inefficient and does not take advantage of the speed of tensors. Let\u2019s implement multi-head attention with the power of tensors.\n\nhead_size = 64 # put at top of file\nclass MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)\n        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick\n        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(head_size, n_emb) # output projection\n        self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\nWe start with our single-head attention implementation. The __init__() function has not changed. The forward pass begins as normal with the creation of the key, query, and value projections.\n\nhead_size = 64 # put at top of file\nn_heads = 8 # put at top of file\nclass MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)\n        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick\n        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(head_size, n_emb) # output projection\n        self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        mha_shape = (B, T, n_heads, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        K = mx.as_strided(K, (mha_shape)) # (B, T, n_heads, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        Q = mx.as_strided(Q, (mha_shape)) # (B, T, n_heads, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        V = mx.as_strided(V, (mha_shape)) # (B, T, n_heads, head_size\/\/n_heads)\nThe next thing we need to do is introduce a new dimension for the number of heads n_heads . In the naive implementation, we had separate attention objects each with their own key, query, and value tensors but now we have them all in one tensor, therefore we need a dimension for the heads. We define the new shape we want in mha_shape . Then we use mx.as_strided() to reshape each tensor to have the head dimension. This function is equivalent to view from pytorch and tells mlx to treat this array as a different shape. But we still have a problem. Notice that we if try to multiply Q @ K_t (where K_t is K transposed over it\u2019s last 2 dims) to compute attention weights as we did before, we will be multiplying the following shapes:\n\n(B, T, n_heads, head_size\/\/n_heads) @ (B, T, head_size\/\/n_heads, n_heads)\nResult shape: (B, T, n_heads, n_heads)\nThis would result in a tensor of shape (B, T, n_heads, n_heads) which is incorrect. With one head our attention weights were shape (B, T, T) which makes sense because it gives us the interaction between each pair of tokens. So now our shape should be the same but with a heads dimension: (B, n_heads, T, T) . We achieve this by transposing the dimensions of keys, queries, and values after we reshape them to make n_heads dimension 1 instead of 2.\n\nhead_size = 64 # put at top of file\nn_heads = 8 # put at top of file\nclass MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(n_emb, head_size, bias=False)\n        indices = mx.arange(ctx_len)\n        mask = indices[:, None] < indices[None] # broadcasting trick\n        self._causal_mask = mask * -1e9\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(head_size, n_emb) # output projection\n        self.attn_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n        self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T, C = x.shape # (batch_size, ctx_len, n_emb)\n        K = self.k_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        Q = self.q_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        V = self.v_proj(x) # (B, T, head_size)\n        mha_shape = (B, T, n_heads, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        K = mx.as_strided(K, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        Q = mx.as_strided(Q, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        V = mx.as_strided(V, (mha_shape)).transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n        attn_weights = (Q @ K.transpose([0, 1, 3, 2])) \/ math.sqrt(Q.shape[-1]) # (B, n_heads, T, T)\n        attn_weights = attn_weights + self._causal_mask[:T, :T]\n        attn_weights = mx.softmax(attn_weights, axis=-1)\n        attn_weights = self.attn_dropout(attn_weights)\n        o = (attn_weights @ V) # (B, n_heads, T, head_size\/\/n_heads)\n\nNow we can calculate the correction attention weights.

First, we move n_heads back to the second to last dimension with the transpose function. Then we reshape back to the original size to undo the splitting into heads we performed earlier. This is the same as concatenating the final vectors from each head. And that\u2019s it for multi-head attention! We\u2019ve gotten through the most intense part of our implementation.\n\nMLP\nThe next part of the architecture is the multilayer perception or MLP. This is a fancy way of saying 2 stacked linear layers. There\u2019s not much to be said here, it is a standard neural network.\n\nclass MLP(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.c_fc = nn.Linear(n_emb, 4 * n_emb)\n        self.gelu = nn.GELU()\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(4 * n_emb, n_emb)\n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        x = self.gelu(self.c_fc(x))\n        x = self.c_proj(x)\n        x = self.dropout(x)\n        return x\nWe take the input and project it to a higher dimension with c_fc . Then we apply gelu nonlinearity and project it back down to the embedding dimension with c_proj . Finally, we apply dropout and return. The purpose of the MLP is to allow for some computation after the vectors have communicated during attention. We will stack these communication layers (attention) and computation layers (mlp) into a block.\n\nBlock\nA GPT block consists of attention followed by an MLP. These blocks will be repeated to make the architecture deep.\n\nclass Block(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.mlp = MLP()\n        self.mha = MultiHeadAttention()\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        x = self.mha(x)\n        x = self.mlp(x)\n        return x\nNow, we need to add two more features to improve training stability. Let\u2019s take a look at the architecture diagram again.\n\nLayernorms and Skip Connections\n\nimage by author\nWe still need to implement the components highlighted in red. The arrows are skip connections. Instead of the input being transformed directly, the effect of the attention and MLP layers is additive. Their result is added to the input instead of directly replacing it. This is good for the training stability of deep networks since in the backward pass, the operands of an addition operation will receive the same gradient as their sum. Gradients can thus flow backwards freely which prevents issues like vanishing\/exploding gradients that plague deep networks. Layernorm also helps with training stability by ensuring activations are normally distributed. Here is the final implementation.\n\nclass Block(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.mlp = MLP()\n        self.mha = MultiHeadAttention()\n        self.ln_1 = nn.LayerNorm(dims=n_emb)\n        self.ln_2 = nn.LayerNorm(dims=n_emb)\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        x = x + self.mha(self.ln_1(x))\n        x = x + self.mlp(self.ln_2(x))\n        return x\nLayernorm is applied before multi-head attention and MLP. The skip connections are added with x = x + ... making the operations additive.\n\nForward Pass\nWith the Block defined, we can finish the full GPT-2 forward pass.\n\nn_layers = 3 # put at top of file\nclass GPT(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.wte = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_emb) # token embeddings\n        self.wpe = nn.Embedding(ctx_len, n_emb) # position embeddings\n        self.blocks = nn.Sequential(\n            *[Block() for _ in range(n_layers)],\n        ) # transformer blocks\n        self.ln_f = nn.LayerNorm(dims=n_emb) # final layernorm\n        self.lm_head = nn.Linear(n_emb, vocab_size) # output projection\n    # Tensor shapes commented\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T = x.shape # (B = batch_size, T = ctx_len)\n        tok_emb = self.wte(x) # (B, T, n_emb)\n        pos_emb = self.wpe(mx.arange(T)) # (T, n_emb)\n        x = tok_emb + pos_emb # (B, T, n_emb)\n        x = self.blocks(x) # (B, T, n_emb)\n        x = self.ln_f(x) # (B, T, b_emb)\n        logits = self.lm_head(x) # (B, T, vocab_size)\n        return logits\nWe create a container for the blocks using nn.Sequential which takes any input and passes it sequentially through the contained layers. Then we can apply all the blocks with self.blocks(x) . Finally, we apply a layer norm and then the lm_head. The lm_head or language modeling head is just a linear layer that maps from the embedding dimension to the vocab size. The model will output a vector containing some value for each word in our vocabulary, or the logits. We can softmax the logits to get a probability distribution over the vocabulary which we can sample from to get the next token. We will also use the logits to calculate the loss during training. There are just two more things we need to implement before we begin training.\n\nSampling\nWe need to write a generate function to sample from the model once training is complete. The idea is that we start with some sequence of our choice, then we predict the next token and append this to our sequence. Then we feed the new sequence in and predict the next token again. This continues until we decide to stop.\n\n# method of GPT class\ndef generate(self, max_new_tokens):\n  ctx = mx.zeros((1, 1), dtype=mx.int32)\nWe prompt the model with a single token, zero. Zero is the newline character so it is a natural place to start the generation since we just want to see how Shakespeare-like our model can get. Note that we initialize the shape to (1, 1) to simulate a single batch with a sequence length of one.\n\n# method of GPT class\ndef generate(self, max_new_tokens):\n  ctx = mx.zeros((1, 1), dtype=mx.int32)\n  for _ in range(max_new_tokens):\n    logits = self(ctx[:, -ctx_len:]) # pass in last ctx_len characters\n    logits = logits[:, -1, :] # get logits for the next token\n    next_tok = mx.random.categorical(logits, num_samples=1)\n    ctx = mx.concatenate((ctx, next_tok), axis=1)\nreturn ctx\nThen we get the logits for the next token by passing in the last ctx_len characters to the model. However, our model output is of shape (B, T, vocab_size) since it predicts the next token logits for each token in the input. We use all of that during training, but now we only want the logits for the last token because we can use this to sample a new token. Therefore we index the logits to get the last element in the first dimension which is the sequence dimension. Then we sample the next token using the mx.random.categorical() function which takes the logits and the number of samples we want as input. This function will softmax the logits to turn them into a probability distribution and then randomly sample a token according to the probabilities. Finally, we concatenate the new token to the context and repeat the process max_new_tokens number of times.\n\nInitialization\nThe last thing to do is handle weight initialization which is important for training dynamics.\n\n# method of GPT\ndef _init_parameters(self):\n    normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)\n    residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 \/ math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))\nFirst, we define two different nn.init.normal functions. The first one is for initializing all linear and embedding layers. The second one is for initializing linear layers that are specifically residual projections i.e. the last linear layer inside multi-head attention and MLP. The reason for this special initialization is that it checks accumulation along the residual path as model depth increases according to the GPT-2 paper [2].\n\nIn mlx we can change the parameters of the model using the mx.update() function. Checking the docs, it expects a complete or partial dictionary of the new model parameters. We can see what this dictionary looks like by printing out self.parameters() inside the GPT class.\n\n{'wte': {'weight': array([[-0.025084, -0.0197523, -0.0341617, ..., -0.0979123, -0.0830218, -0.0784692],\n       [-0.00777913, -0.117002, -0.0310708, ..., 0.0128591, 0.122941, 0.000414443],\n       [0.0240044, -0.0859084, 0.0253116, ..., 0.108967, 0.0767123, 0.0221565],\n       ...,\n       [0.050729, -0.04578, 0.0685943, ..., -0.0496998, -0.00350879, -0.00631825],\n       [0.00518804, 0.0499818, 0.0330045, ..., 0.0300661, 0.0431054, 0.000958906],\n       [-0.0323007, 0.0132046, 0.0208218, ..., -0.0785159, 0.00436121, -0.00726994]], dtype=float32)}, 'wpe': {'weight': array([[0.000797923, -0.0396898, -0.029047, ..., -0.0132273, 0.00684483, -0.0067624],\n       [-0.0247021, -0.0274349, 0.0310587, ..., -0.100099, 0.0301566, -0.0178732],\n       [0.0929172, -0.0468649, 0.0101506, ..., -0.0341086, -0.0516283, 0.0447596],\n       ...,\n       [-0.0508172, 0.0892201, -0.00183612, ..., -0.00341944, 0.023437, 0.0296461],\n       [0.0105829, 0.0688093, 0.146744, ..., -0.0836337, 0.0206679, 0.0184166],\n       [-0.00578717, -0.0606196, -0.0917056, ..., -0.0641549, -0.0490424, 0.0998114]], dtype=float32)}, 'blocks': {'layers': [{'mlp': {'c_fc': {'weight': array([[0.0169199, 0.00264431, 0.0316978, ..., -0.0596867, -0.0153549, 0.0176386],\n       ...\nIt\u2019s a nested dictionary containing each model weight as an mx.array. So to initialize the parameters of our model we need to build up a dictionary like this with our new params and pass them to self.update() . We can achieve this as follows:\n\n# method of GPT\ndef _init_parameters(self):\n    normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)\n    residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 \/ math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))\n    new_params = []\n    for name, module in self.named_modules():\n        if isinstance(module, nn.layers.linear.Linear):\n            new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))\n        elif isinstance(module, nn.layers.embedding.Embedding):\n            new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)\nWe maintain a list of tuples called new_params which will contain tuples of (parameter_name, new_value). Next, we loop through each nn.Module object in our model with self.named_modules() which returns tuples of (name, module). If we print out the module names within the loop we see that they look like this:\n\nlm_head\nblocks\nblocks.layers.4\nblocks.layers.3\nblocks.layers.3.ln_2\nblocks.layers.3.ln_1\nblocks.layers.3.mha\nblocks.layers.3.mha.resid_dropout\nblocks.layers.3.mha.c_proj\nblocks.layers.3.mha.attn_dropout\nblocks.layers.3.mha.c_attn\n...\nblocks.layers.0.mlp.dropout\nblocks.layers.0.mlp.c_proj\nblocks.layers.0.mlp.gelu\nblocks.layers.0.mlp.c_fc\nwpe\nwte\nWe use the isinstance() function to find the linear and embedding layers and then add them to our list. For example, say we are looping and reach \u201cblocks.layers.0.mlp.c_fc\u201d which is the first linear layer in the MLP. This would trigger the first if statement, and the tuple (\"block.layers.0.mlp.c_fc.weight\", [<normally initialized weight here>]) would be added to our list. We have to add \u201c.weight\u201d to the name because we specifically want to initialize the weight in this way, not the bias. Now we need to handle the residual projection initialization.\n\n# method of GPT\ndef _init_parameters(self):\n    normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)\n    residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 \/ math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))\n    new_params = []\n    for name, module in self.named_modules():\n        if isinstance(module, nn.layers.linear.Linear):\n            if 'c_proj' in name: # residual projection\n                new_params.append((name + '.weight', residual_init(module.weight)))\n            else:\n                new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))\n        elif isinstance(module, nn.layers.embedding.Embedding):\n            new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))\nAfter checking if the module is a linear layer, we check if \u201cc_proj\u201d is in the name because that\u2019s how we named the residual projections. Then we can apply the special initialization. Finally, we need to initialize the biases to be zero.\n\n# method of GPT\ndef _init_parameters(self):\n    normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)\n    residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 \/ math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))\n    new_params = []\n    for name, module in self.named_modules():\n        if isinstance(module, nn.layers.linear.Linear):\n            if 'c_proj' in name:\n                new_params.append((name + '.weight', residual_init(module.weight)))\n            else:\n                new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))\n            if 'bias' in module:\n                new_params.append((name + '.bias', mx.zeros(module.bias.shape)))\n        elif isinstance(module, nn.layers.embedding.Embedding):\n            new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))\n    self = self.update(utils.tree_unflatten(new_params))\nWe add another if statement under our linear branch to check if the nn.Module object has a bias attribute. If it does, we add it to the list initialized to zeros. Finally, we need to transform our list of tuples into a nested dictionary. Luckily mlx has some functions implemented for dealing with parameter dictionaries, and we can use util.tree_unflatten() to convert this list of tuples to a nested parameter dictionary. This is passed into the update method to initialize the parameters. Now we can call _init_parameters() in the constructor.\n\nclass GPT(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.wte = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_emb) # token embeddings\n        self.wpe = nn.Embedding(ctx_len, n_emb) # position embeddings\n        self.blocks = nn.Sequential(\n            *[Block() for _ in range(n_layers)],\n        ) # transformer blocks\n        self.ln_f = nn.LayerNorm(dims=n_emb) # final layernorm\n        self.lm_head = nn.Linear(n_emb, vocab_size) # output projection\n        self._init_parameters() # <-- initialize params\n        # print total number of params on initialization\n        total_params = sum([p.size for n,p in utils.tree_flatten(self.parameters())])\n        print(f\"Total params: {(total_params \/ 1e6):.3f}M\")\n    # Tensor shapes commented\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        B, T = x.shape # (B = batch_size, T = ctx_len)\n        tok_emb = self.wte(x) # (B, T, n_emb)\n        pos_emb = self.wpe(mx.arange(T)) # (T, n_emb)\n        x = tok_emb + pos_emb # (B, T, n_emb)\n        x = self.blocks(x) # (B, T, n_emb)\n        x = self.ln_f(x) # (B, T, b_emb)\n        logits = self.lm_head(x) # (B, T, vocab_size)\n        return logits\n    def generate(self, max_new_tokens):\n        ctx = mx.zeros((1, 1), dtype=mx.int32)\n        for _ in range(max_new_tokens):\n          logits = self(ctx[:, -ctx_len:]) # pass in last ctx_len characters\n          logits = logits[:, -1, :] # get logits for the next token\n          next_tok = mx.random.categorical(logits, num_samples=1)\n          ctx = mx.concatenate((ctx, next_tok), axis=1)\n        return ctx\n    def _init_parameters(self):\n        normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)\n        residual_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=(0.02 \/ math.sqrt(2 * n_layers)))\n        new_params = []\n        for name, module in self.named_modules():\n            if isinstance(module, nn.layers.linear.Linear):\n                if 'c_proj' in name:\n                    new_params.append((name + '.weight', residual_init(module.weight)))\n                else:\n                    new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))\n                if 'bias' in module:\n                    new_params.append((name + '.bias', mx.zeros(module.bias.shape)))\n            elif isinstance(module, nn.layers.embedding.Embedding):\n                new_params.append((name + '.weight', normal_init(module.weight)))\n        self = self.update(utils.tree_unflatten(new_params))\n\nWe also add 2 lines of code in the constructor to print the total number of params. Finally, we are ready to build the training loop.\n\nTraining Loop\nTo train the model we need a loss function. Since we are predicting classes (next token) we use cross-entropy loss.\n\ndef loss_fn(model, x, y):\n    logits = model(x)\n    B, T, C = logits.shape # (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size)\n    logits = logits.reshape(B*T, C)\n    y = y.reshape(B*T)\n    loss = nn.losses.cross_entropy(logits, y, reduction='mean')\n    return loss\nFirst, we get the logits from the model. Then we reshape logits to make a list of vocab_size length arrays. We also reshape y, the correct token ids, to have the same length. Then we use the built-in cross-entropy loss function to calculate the loss for each example and average them to get a single value.\n\nmodel = GPT()\nmx.eval(model.parameters()) # Create the model params (mlx is lazy evaluation)\nloss_and_grad = nn.value_and_grad(model, loss_fn)\nlr = 0.1\noptimizer = optim.AdamW(learning_rate=lr)\nNext, we instantiate the model, but since mlx is lazy evaluation it won\u2019t allocate and create the parameters. We need to call mx.eval on the parameters to ensure they get created. Then we can use nn.value_and_grad() to get a function that returns the loss and gradient of model parameters w.r.t the loss. This is all we need to optimize. Finally, we initialize an AdamW optimizer.\n\nA quick note on nn.value_and_grad(). If you are used to PyTorch you might expect us to use loss.backward() which goes through the computation graph and updates the .grad attribute of each tensor in our model. However, mlx automatic differentiation works on functions instead of computation graphs [3]. Therefore, mlx has built-ins that take in a function and return the gradient function such as nn.value_and_grad() .\n\nNow we define the training loop.\n\nnum_epochs=20\nbatch_size=32\nfor epoch in range(num_epochs):\n    model.train(True)\n    running_loss = 0\n    batch_cnt = 0\n    for input, label in get_batches(X_train, y_train, batch_size):\n        batch_cnt += 1\n        loss, grads = loss_and_grad(model, input, label)\n        optimizer.update(model, grads)\n        running_loss += loss.item()\n        # compute new parameters and optimizer state\n        mx.eval(model.parameters(), optimizer.state)\n    avg_train_loss = running_loss \/ batch_cnt\n    model.train(False) # set eval mode\n    running_loss = 0\n    batch_cnt = 0\n    for input, label in get_batches(X_val, y_val, batch_size):\n        batch_cnt += 1\n        loss = loss_fn(model, input, label)\n        running_loss += loss.item()\n    avg_val_loss = running_loss \/ batch_cnt\n    print(f\"Epoch {epoch:2} | train = {avg_train_loss:.4f} | val = {avg_val_loss:.4f}\")\nThe outer loop runs through the epochs. We first set the model to training mode because some modules have different behaviors during training and testing such as dropout. Then we use our get_batches function from earlier to loop through batches of the training data. We get the loss over the batch and the gradient using loss_and_grad . Then we pass the model and gradients to the optimizer to update the model parameters. Finally we call mx.eval (remember mlx does lazy evaluation) to ensure the parameters and optimizer state get updated. Then we calculate the average train loss over the data to print later. This is one pass through the training data. Similarly, we calculate the validation loss and then print the average train and val loss over the epoch.\n\ncompletion = decode(model.generate(1000)[0].tolist())\nprint(completion)\nwith open('completions.txt', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(completion)\nFinally, we add some code to generate from our model. Since the generation output is still in the (B, T) shape we have to index it at 0 to make it 1D and then convert it from an mlx array to a Python list. Then we can pass it to our decode function from earlier, and write it to a file.\n\nThese are the parameters we will use for training (you can play around with this):\n\nctx_len = 128\nn_emb = 128\ndropout = 0.1\nhead_size = 128\nn_heads = 4\nn_layers = 3\nnum_epochs = 20\nbatch_size = 64\nlr = 1e-3\nNow we can run the file to start training. With the settings above training took around 10 minutes on my m2 MacBook. I achieved the following training loss last epoch.\n\nEpoch 19 | train = 1.6961 | val = 1.8143\nLet\u2019s look at some output.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nBut accomes mo move it.\n\nKING EDWARD:\nWhere our that proclaim that I curse, or I sprithe.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nNot want:\nHis bops to thy father\nAt with hath folk; by son and fproathead:\nThe good nor may prosperson like it not,\nWhat, the beggares\nMore hath, when that made a,\nYour vainst Citizen:\nLet here are go in queen me and knife\nTo my deserved me you promise: not a fettimes,\nThat one the will not.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nAnd been of queens,\nThou to do we best!\n\nJULIET:\nNot, brother recourable this doth our accuse\nInto fight!\nNot bad for just 10 minutes of training with a tiny model that is predicting characters!

{"document_index":9,"context":"\u2018The Zone Of Interest\u2019 Ending Explained & Film Summary: What Happens To Rudolf And Hedwig Hoss?\nPUBLISHED\n\nFEBRUARY 21, 2024\nBY\nSOURYA SUR ROY\n0COMMENTS\nThe Zone Of Interest Ending Explained Film Summary Hedwig Ross, Rudolph Ross\nCredits: A24\nThe Zone of Interest is a new historical drama film by English filmmaker Jonathan Glazer that manages to recreate a terrible moment from history with a unique and devastating effect. Loosely adapted from Martin Amis\u2019 novel of the same name, the film\u2019s plot follows the Hoss family, who live right beside the Auschwitz concentration camp, going about their usual lives with no concern for the terrible crimes being committed right outside. The Zone of Interest is all about subtle, indirect expressions that are poignant enough to pierce through the visual layer, successfully making the viewer all the more uncomfortable with every passing minute.\n\nSpoiler Alert\n\nPlot Summary: What Is The Film About?\nThe Zone of Interest opens with a noticeably long black screen, with only a soft sound being eerily stretched in the background, perhaps preparing us for what is to unfold on screen over the next hundred or so minutes. When the visuals come on, though, there is nothing unusual or out of the ordinary, as a family is seen spending some personal time by the forested banks of a river. This is a secluded spot reserved only for the family, and it seems to be their most common way of spending leisure time. As the girls are led by a nanny through the bushes, possibly for some lesson in gardening and wildlife, the boys jump into the river along with their father. Sometime later, the family reunites and leaves the riverbank, driving away in two black, sinister-looking cars. On that very night, the father of the house is seen going around, switching off all the lights, before going to bed.\n\nWhile there is really nothing odd in this whole presentation of a family spending a day with themselves, the chilling reality of the matter is revealed when the film introduces the particular lot. The family is that of Rudolf Hoss, a notorious real figure from history, infamous for being a distinguished SS officer and the commander of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Most of the entire film, and the whole of the opening scene, actually takes place in Auschwitz, meaning that the leisurely picnic of the big family literally took place only a few miles away from the spot of the ongoing genocide. This is the very premise of The Zone of Interest, for it shows the tumultuous time of history from the perspective of the Hoss family, mainly the patriarch Rudolf and his wife, Hedwig.\n\nThe couple lives in an idyllic resort with their two sons and three daughters, the youngest still a baby, right on the other side of the high walls of the concentration camp. Despite the inhuman torture and killing going on right outside the walls that separate their lives, the Hoss family members are not perturbed by the matter at all. Instead, they are rather accustomed to Auschwitz, cherishing their time and accepting it as their new home.\n\nHow Does The Film Powerfully Present The Harrowing Events Of The Holocaust?\nThe most remarkable thing about The Zone of Interest is how it manages to say so much without directly saying it, combining the visual and the aural through a unique dissonance. With regards to the visuals, meaning scenes that play out to take forward the mostly simple and common story, the camera hardly ever leaves the confines of the host house. While some exceptions take place towards the latter part of the film, when Rudolf is transferred to a different concentration camp and he is seen at his new post, almost no scene of the camp in Auschwitz is seen. But the audio track picks up on numerous cries, lashes, and sounds that clearly come from the outside world but are heavily ignored. There is only one brief scene in which we are shown a side-angled close-up of Rudolf while he is at his workplace, which is a camp intended to kill Jews by the thousands. Indeed, the man is shot looking at the work he is rather proud of doing, amidst thick smoke bellowing out and loud cries and shrieks of helpless people. Rudolf certainly has no reservations about overseeing a genocide, but the film particularly shines with respect to how it uses the very usual to highlight the horrific context in the backdrop.\n\nEarly on in the film, Rudolf\u2019s family and his subordinates celebrate the man\u2019s birthday with a fancy cake, and all the Nazi soldiers come to his house to greet him. This merrymaking literally takes place all while hundreds, if not thousands, of families, are kept locked in the concentration camps and forced into the gas chambers. But nobody seems to notice, or rather, everyone pretends to look through the entire matter, as if nothing shocking is in the works. Rudolf is also seen meeting with a businessman in his house, who comes to show the commander plans and designs for a new, more effective gas chamber that he wants to build for his government. Rudolf goes through the plans without any hesitation and then also reports about this businessman\u2019s portfolio to his higher authorities, convinced that sturdier and better-designed gas chambers are needed to take his beloved nation and his government forward. The Zone of Interest does not really differentiate between evil-doers and those supporting such evil, but Rudolf is definitely in the first category, as he clearly enjoys the torture and killing of people.\n\nWhat comes as even a bigger shock is the reaction of his wife, Hedwig, for she does not react to any of these massacres either. Rather, the woman is extremely accustomed to the life of the commander\u2019s wife, and she enjoys the perks it brings along. She often receives luxury and expensive items that have been taken away from the prisoners, and on one particular occasion, she is seen receiving a fancy fur coat, since the Nazis did not differentiate between the rich and the poor among their targets. Hedwig immediately throws the coat on her body and tries it out in front of the mirror, only to realize that there is still lipstick lying inside one of the pockets. The presence of the lipstick would obviously be a bold reminder to anyone of the previous owner of the coat and the atrocious torture she must be subjected to at present. However, Hedwig has been wired to not think like that, and instead of any guilt or remorse, she feels rather excited to try on the lipstick, which is now hers as well.\n\nHedwig maintains a calm and composed nature, without any worry in the world, as she focuses on her gardening and getting a pool built for her children in their compound. The thick, dark smoke from the chimneys of the gas chambers on one side and from the steam engine train that brings in Jewish prisoners every day on the other does not affect the woman at all. The irony of the matter is all the more glaring when Hedwig is absolutely livid that her husband has to be transferred away from Auschwitz. She decides to stay back at the place along with her children because she is unwilling to uproot the life she had built there, including the fancy garden and the greenhouse, and shift somewhere else, which is probably too cold for her comfort as well. The fact that thousands were being faced with worse persecution and millions more would be uprooted, killed, or left disbanded very easily eludes her thought. In this regard, Jonathan Glazer\u2019s film is a really fascinating note on not just the Holocaust but also the effect of systematized violence and the tendency of the masses to side with the oppressors in any given scenario.\n\nThe Hoss children are also equally desensitized to seeing murder and killing around them. The boys play around with toy soldiers, all waging war against invisible enemies. Shockingly, they are also seen collecting and playing with gold teeth, which are literally the remains of people who had been killed in the camp. One of the daughters does seem to feel something odd about their house, or she simply sleepwalks as a habit and sits by the door as if waiting for someone to arrive. Nonetheless, this young girl would also grow accustomed to the situation one day and not find anything strange about it. The Jewish prisoners are allowed to get close to the house and the family, as many of them are given the task of cleaning the boots and bringing supplies to the place. But there is also a clear distinction that the Nazi commander maintains from them, which highlights the pure hatred breeding inside his perspective of the people. As soon as Rudolf finds a skull and some ashes in the river that he and his sons were bathing in, he scurries back to his house, and the children are scrubbed clean with utmost precision. In another instance, it is suggested that Rudolf forces himself upon a helpless prisoner woman, but he ensures that he scrubs his private parts before retiring for the night.\n\nThe only exception to the unaffected response by the entire family is by Hedwig\u2019s mother, who finds it bizarre that her daughter, her husband, and their children can really live at such a place. The elderly woman definitely has no sympathies for the prisoners, though, but she is rather unable to live with so many signs and reminders of death all around. The stench of burning human bodies and the ash flying around keep her up all night, but the very same elements are like playthings for the two young boys who still lay awake in their room. On a similar night, filled with reminders of the ongoing genocide, Hedwig is seen asking Rudolf to take her on a romantic trip, in the most romantic conversation between the couple in the film. Ultimately, the mother leaves the house unannounced very early the next morning, only leaving behind a note for her daughter. Hedwig simply tosses the note into her furnace insignificantly, almost insulted that someone would find her beloved home distasteful or discomforting. Even after Rudolf leaves for Oranienburg, Hedwig stays at their Auschwitz house with the children.\n\nWhat Do The Scenes In Infrared Signify?\nThe Zone of Interest also sparsely presents a few scenes, in which an unacquainted young girl is seen going around Auschwitz, hiding apples and other meager food items inside the trenches. She is clearly doing this extremely dangerous work only to help the prisoners and ease their suffering in whatever little way she can. But interestingly, these scenes are in infrared, or negative, although only as long as the girl is in the outside world. As soon as she returns home, the visuals turn normal, then switch to infrared when she or her mother step out on the balcony. The family is revealed to be Polish locals who have no interest in Nazi ideals and dream of liberation one day. However, the mere fact that the family is still alive, irrespective of whether they are Jewish or not, suggests that they also have to work as collaborators for the Nazis to a certain degree. This was definitely the case with numerous non-Jews during the Nazi occupation who had to work for the horrific authorities despite not wanting to. Going by that logic, the significance of the use of infrared might be in stating how the family cannot be themselves as soon as they step out of their house or into the open balcony as well. Although the girl takes on the dangerous responsibility of helping the prisoners, she still cannot express her true self in public, leading to her being shown in infrared. Another perspective is that the girl and her mother truly stand out in this horrific world solely because of their generous actions. Therefore, in a film like this, in which the Nazis and the enablers are the \u201cnormal\u201d people, anyone with any sense of humanity has to be visually differentiated from the Hoss family members.\n\nWhat Happens To Rudolf Hoss?\nDuring The Zone of Interest\u2018s ending, Rudolf is seen in his Berlin office as he telephones Hedwig and tells her about his excitement for the concentration camps being built. Rudolf had been given the responsibility of overseeing a new Nazi order in which Hungarian Jews were to be arrested and killed. Although Hedwig refuses to be part of this very direct talk of violence, for she prefers such matters to be in the background, the commander still feels thrilled. He is seen walking down the stairs from his office when suddenly bouts of violent retching hit him on two occasions. In the middle of these two instances, The Zone of Interest briefly moves to modern times, and various reminders of the Holocaust are seen being maintained at the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, right before the place is opened to public visitors. The last scene returns to the past once more, and Rudolf is seen feeling slightly odd, as if someone is watching him, as he continues down the stairs.\n\nThe Zone of Interest\u2018s ending scene seems to suggest that deep in his conscience, Rudolf Hoss does know that his actions can only make one retch, and almost like a fortune-teller, he has an uneasy feeling that his legacy will go down terribly in history. The scene of the museum is a fast jolt back to the right perspective, which had been missing throughout the film. Throughout the entire duration of The Zone of Interest, Rudolf, his family, and his professional associates had all been extremely invested in hiding the evidence and changing the narrative, but ultimately, the thousands of shoes or the torn, ragged uniforms still exist as reminders of the horrible genocide.","query":"How do the people who commit atrocious acts and those that are complicit in these acts differ?","ground_truth":"The Zone of Interest does not really differentiate between evil-doers and those supporting such evil.","response_correct":"The film shows little distinction between those who commit atrocities and those who enable them.","response_wrong":"The film clearly shows that only those who directly commit atrocities are responsible, while bystanders are depicted as innocent."}
{"document_index":14,"context":"My eyes felt like galaxies\u2014holding the swirling glow of countless memories\u2014as I took in our childhood home. Its siding looked like remnants of driftwood after a bonfire. I swore I smelled the smoky char of pine creep into my nostrils. It\u2019s wild how the past stays with you like that. It can feel more visceral and real than the tangible things right in front of you.\n\n\u201cJesus, it feels like just yesterday.\u201d I placed a trembling hand over my heart, struggling to steady my breath.\n\nMy brother, Perry, pulled me into a tight embrace, his strength grounding me like an anchor.\n\n\u201cThe house hasn\u2019t changed much,\u201d he said, his voice steady and comforting. \u201cBut we have.\u201d His certainty made me question, Have I really changed?\n\nBetween the two of us, Perry was as solid and stoic as a mountain range. Good thing, because I was like the wind\u2014flighty and unpredictable. Over the years, Perry had learned to handle even my harshest hurricanes.\n\nBeing his older sister\u2014even if only by four minutes\u2014I always wished I\u2019d been his protector rather than the other way around. But that demon burning deep in my belly also flashed a crooked smile, knowing that Perry would never abandon me, especially since I got sober.\n\nI hadn\u2019t had a drink in exactly seven hundred and thirty days, and although it remained unsaid, I knew Perry was terrified of leaving me to my own devices in fear I would relapse.\n\nOur sibling bond was iron-clad. After we lost our parents in the fire (my mother didn\u2019t properly butt out her 2:00 am cigarette and well, the rest is history), all Perry and I had was each other. But let\u2019s call a spade a spade; we were also as fucked up and as co-dependent as it gets. Who mutually decides to visit the catalyst of your alcohol addiction on the anniversary of your sobriety?\n\nThe house\u2019s dilapidated front door creaked as Perry gently pushed it open. The rusted metal hinges were holding it up by a thread.\n\n\u201cAfter you.\u201d Perry gestured me in, squinting from the sunlight. He was a gentleman, even in such obscurity.\n\nAs he held the door open, the shallow scar on his right cheek taunted me like some kind of schoolyard bully. His wound often pulled me in like that. Some days, I was sure I would dive right into it and drown. Other days, I prayed to God and the Devil himself to just let me fucking drown, already.\n\nThat mark became permanently etched on Perry\u2019s face on the day I quit drinking, exactly seven hundred and thirty days ago. That was the day Perry screamed bloody murder at me from the passenger seat, \u201cJackie! Stop the fucking car!\u201d But my bloodstream was far too poisoned with Bacardi Limon to listen. All I remember next was my vehicle being wrapped around a tree. I could have died that day, but what truly disturbed me in the middle of the night was the fact that I almost killed Perry.\n\nA lot can happen in seven hundred and thirty days. But I assure you, forgiving yourself isn\u2019t one of them.\n\n\u201cWell? You coming in?\u201d Perry was still holding the door ajar.\n\nI shook it off and gave my brother a knowing glance. I swear, even though we were fraternal, we had twin telepathy. I exhaled and walked in.\n\n\u201cWatch your step,\u201d I warned, my forehead tense.\n\nI imagined the rickety floorboards collapsing, crashing us into what had once been our dad\u2019s \u201cman cave\u201d. That\u2019s where he was passed out, the night of the fire.\n\n\u201cKids, stay here. Do not move,\u201d our mother demanded after getting us out of the house safely. I remember the black soot on her face and the spiderweb veins in her eyes. She shook us firmly by the forearms. \u201cI\u2019m getting your father.\u201d\n\nPerry and I held each other, shaking. The heat from the inferno felt like standing in a volcano. We never saw our parents again.\n\nTwo decades later, there we were\u2014Perry and I\u2014-making our way through the wreckage of our home. It was midday, yet the inside of the house screamed a tone of pale blue midnight. My shoulders were up to my ears, as though we were walking through a haunted house attraction.\n\nI coughed into my forearm. The ocean of dust was thick like butter. As I cleared my lungs, Perry called out from behind me.\n\n\u201cJacks, look at this! The fireplace,\u201d Perry's voice was filled with awe.\n\n\u201cUnbelievable. It\u2019s still here,\u201d I whispered, a lump forming in my throat.\n\nIt was as though a Fairy Godmother breezed by and brought the decaying living room to life with her magical paintbrush. Kind of like in \u201cTitanic\u201d, when they showed the sunken ship underwater, versus in its prestige as it sailed across the Atlantic.\n\nWe made our way over to the fireplace and sat cross-legged on the floor.\n\n\u201cThis was our favorite spot, remember?\u201d I avoided his gaze, overwhelmed by the flood of memories.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Perry murmured, his eyes softening with nostalgia.\n\nFor a moment, the taste of crispy, fire roasted marshmallows superseded the saturated stench of mildew.\n\n\u201cRemember our s\u2019mores nights?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cDuh. What about all our fireplace movie nights?\u201d Perry proceeded to do his best, nasally, childhood impersonation of me, \u201cBut mom! I want to watch Beauty and the Beast!! Perry always gets to pick the movie!!\u201d\n\nI punched him in the arm, \u201cFirst of all, I never sounded like that. And second. So what? I knew what I wanted.\u201d\n\nThe corners of Perry\u2019s mouth lifted. He had such a sincere sparkle about him, as though a storm cloud of confetti followed him overhead wherever he went, \u201cYou really did, kiddo.\u201d\n\nMy chest went heavy. How could Perry love me after everything I had done? After all the relationships I\u2019d ruined? All the jobs I\u2019d lost? All of his relationships I\u2019d ruined? How could he still choose me, when so often I had chosen a forty of Jack Daniels over him?\n\nHow could Perry still love me after I almost fucking killed him?\n\nPerry\u2019s gaze widened, \u201cHey! Remember when Mom would bring out those hot drinks she always made?\u201d He paused, almost as if he was searching for the right term. \u201cApple\u2026 something? Apple ssshhh\u2026\u201d\n\nI snapped my fingers, \u201cApple-Schnapple!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, looking back it was basically just hot apple cider, but damn it was good.\u201d And it really was.\n\nOur laughs echoed throughout the abandoned asylum we once called home.\n\nPerry leaned back, holding himself up with his hands. \u201cI loved our fireplace hangs. Especially our movie nights down here. But nothing beats our movies up in the projector room.\u201d\n\nI tilted my head, \u201cWe never had a projector room.\u201d\n\nPerry playfully \u201cshoo\u2019d\u201d me away.\n\n\u201cNo. Perry. I would remember us having a projector room. Our movie nights together were our favorite thing. You even just said it yourself.\u201d\n\nThe house suddenly became pin-drop silent as Perry leaned in. \"Memories are quite something, aren\u2019t they?\" The slight shift in his tone made my skin crawl. Perry was always wistful, but this felt different, almost\u2026 clinical, \"We often remember things in ways that are\u2026 easier for us to digest.\"\n\nI was fidgety. \u201cGees Perry. You sound like Dr. Lasko.\u201d\n\nHe seemed to enjoy my little joke.\n\nDr. Lasko had been my therapist since the accident, and I would go out on a limb and say that he would not have approved of this self-inflicted exposure therapy I was subjecting myself to by visiting the house.\n\nPerry seemingly snapped out of his little therapist moment and went right back to being his sparkly confetti self. As I watched his amicable face scan the mantle above the fireplace, I felt a sickening uneasiness. Imagine you had actually fucking killed him.\n\n\u201cMan, I can still picture all our family photos up there,\u201d Perry\u2019s childlike wonder destroyed me.\n\nMy face went flush. I could feel the water rising in my eyes like the tides. How pathetic and infuriating was it that after everything I\u2019d done, I was still somehow the victim.\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d He took my hand.\n\n\u201cOh Perry,\u201d  I threw myself into him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nMy brother held me with his usual care that I didn\u2019t deserve.\n\n\u201cJacks, it\u2019s ok. I\u2019m still here. We\u2019re both still here.\u201d\n\nAs my chin rested on my brother\u2019s shoulder, I looked ahead of me at the remains of the house. Something felt off, and it wasn\u2019t just the overall unsettling environment. My brow furrowed. \u201cWasn\u2019t the doorway to the kitchen on the other side of the living room?\u201d\n\nI felt Perry shrug, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nI was staring into the out of place doorway like I was trying to pull a recollection towards me. And that\u2019s when I saw them in the kitchen: the translucent memory of mom and dad. Mom was getting our Apple-Schnapples ready. She was pacing, unlike Dad, who was sitting motionless at the table. His face was planted on its mahogany surface. His glass of Apple-Schnapple was empty, and so was the bottle of Jim Beam beside it.\n\nMom floated into the living room, our warm beverages in hand and a cigarette in her mouth, \u201cKids, your father\u2019s not feeling well. Let\u2019s have our Apple-Schnapples in here.\u201d\n\nOh my God. The bruise on her face.\n\nPerry jarred me back to reality with the gut punch of what he had to say next, \u201cYou\u2019re remembering the truth about mom and dad, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI pushed myself off and away from him. \u201cHow did you\u2026\u201d\n\nMy brother looked down, delicately tracing the floor with his finger, \u201cWe always put them on a pedestal after they died.\u201d\n\nI felt a shiver run down my spine, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\nAs Perry continued to speak, his words grew even more detached. \"Do you remember that first drink Dad ever gave you?\"\n\nMy eyes darted around the room as my jugular pulsed in my neck. As much as I tried to escape what Perry had just said, I did remember.\n\nI could hear my dad\u2019s slurring words of encouragement, \u201cCome on, Jackie. Just one drink. It\u2019ll be our special time, just you and me.\u201d\n\nThe bitterness of that first sip of beer made me squirm, but sharing a \u201cspecial time\u201d with my dad\u2014and the desperate yearning that maybe he did love me, afterall\u2014was the overwhelm of the full moon swallowing me whole. I was only a child, and much like how my mom turned a blind eye to my father\u2019s drinking, she did the exact same when it came to her daughter.\n\nI\u2019d used the death of my parents as the excuse for my alcoholism for so long, because admitting that they helped create the monster I would eventually become was like a knife to the heart. And knowing I had been too weak to conquer the addiction from my own volition just made the weapon twist in my chest.\n\nThe room was spinning. My face was blistering hot like the night of the fire. Or was that the warm heat from the fireplace when we were kids? The childhood fireplace memories ran through my mind, frame by frame, until\u2026..they eventually vaporized to nothing. I crouched over, thinking I might vomit.\n\n\u201cWe never had a fireplace.\u201d Perry was nodding, very matter-of-factly.\n\nMy fingernails dug into my thighs when I looked at the fireplace and: it was gone. Only a blank wall of faded, forest green wallpaper remained. Our house was once on fire, yes, but that was it. There was never a happy childhood fireplace. Ever.\n\nMy hands were cold and clammy. I fell back onto the wall behind me. \u201cPerry. Where are we?\u201d\n\nHe stood up and glided towards the staircase. One hand on the banister, his footsteps creaked, one by one, as he made his way to the second floor.\n\nMy mouth was bone dry, \u201cPerry!\u201d\n\nHe stopped and turned towards me, \u201cCome to the projector room. We love watching movies together, don\u2019t we? There\u2019s a movie I\u2019d like to show you.\u201d\n\nAs my brother disappeared from sight, I did what any classic horror movie trope would tell you to do: I went upstairs.\n\nI found Perry standing at the end of the ominous hallway. Large, empty picture frames lined the oxblood walls leading up to him. Through the doorway where Perry stood, particles in the air danced in the projector\u2019s cone-shaped light. That telltale winding of a film reel was the only sound in the deafening quiet of this house that I no longer recognized.\n\nHalf of Perry\u2019s face\u2014the one with the scar\u2014was perfectly illuminated, as though he was wearing the mask from \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera\u201d. \u201cI think you\u2019re ready to see how this movie ends, Jackie. This is the most progress you\u2019ve made since we\u2019ve been coming here.\u201d\n\nI gripped my thumbs in the palms of my hands, \u201cPerry, you\u2019re freaking the fuck out of me!\u201d\n\nI thought my knees might buckle as my brother\u2019s face glitched, like a flash of static snow on a television set. As his face settled back to normal to a deadpan gaze, he disappeared in the innocuous room. I followed, running on nothing but fumes.\n\nClutching the doorway, my mouth fell agape. Perry was gone. I darted to the middle of the room.\n\nAs I frantically searched for my brother, I shielded my eyes with the back of my hand from the projector\u2019s light. And that\u2019s when, from behind me, I heard five words that made my blood run cold, \u201cJackie! Stop the fucking car!\u201d\n\nI was convulsing yet paralyzed. Moving as slowly as cold molasses, I rotated on the spot towards my worst nightmare, shown on 35 mm. On the projector screen was Perry and me in my car, exactly seven hundred and thirty days ago, the day I almost kill\u2014\n\nOh my God.\n\nMy head pounded as fragmented memories surged. The reality of what happened began to crystallize, unrelenting.\n\nMy joints ached and my stomach churned. Clamping a hand over my mouth to stifle a scream, I stumbled down the hallway as it began caving in on itself. The picture frames were sucked into the walls. The floorboards cracked into distorted peaks and valleys. Wooden beams swung down from the ceiling like pendulums. I tried to spit out the chalky grit of disintegrating drywall that made the hallway look like a winter squall.\n\nPanting heavily, I stopped dead in my tracks at the stained glass window. My body trembled with an all-too-familiar dread. Each time I faced this, I wondered if this fall would be the one that would finally end it all.\n\nMaybe it\u2019d be better if it did.\n\nHolding my breath, I threw myself through the glass, my hands clawing the air for dear life. Free falling two stories feels like an eternity when you\u2019re watching the memory of your childhood home fall apart before your very eyes. But when the weight of my body finally made contact with the earth I\u2014\n\nI gasped. The cold air of the hospital room shocked my lungs. I sat up, ripping the suction cups from my face and body. My gown was clinging to me, soaked in sweat. Medical equipment beeped all around me like a metronome.\n\nDr. Lasko, my therapist since the accident, sat across the stark white room, sighing as he rubbed his forehead. He, too, was connected to a plethora of suction cups and wires. He looked a little worn out in the fluorescent overhead lighting. Ever since I was hospitalized and later incarcerated, Dr. Lasko had been helping me delve into my memories, namely the ones that were too excruciating for me to face. And as such, Dr. Lasko had been appearing in the simulations as my brother Perry, the love of my life who died in the car crash, seven hundred and thirty days prior.\n\nDisoriented, I blinked rapidly, the vividness of the memory contrasting sharply with the sterile, geometric ceiling tiles above me.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to do that again!\u201d I was venomous.\n\n\u201cJackie,\u201d Dr. Lasko started.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d I pulled up four fingers for air quotes, \u201c\u2018Jackie, don\u2019t give up. This was the closest you\u2019ve ever come to facing the truth.\u201d\n\nAs the initial burst of adrenal and cortisol left my body, I fell back on my pillow. I was depleted. Quiet rivers flowed down my cheeks.\n\nRemoving his own suction cups, Dr. Lasko approached my bedside and took a seat. He treaded lightly. \u201cJackie, I understand how challenging this is for you, but you did an incredible job today. If we continue making progress like this, there's a real possibility you'll gain your freedom sooner.\u201d\n\nI looked at the well-meaning doctor, but all I could see was Perry. Multicolored confetti fell softly around him like that first November snow. His face was the sun. His eyes reflected the whole world back to me.\n\nPerry.\n\nWith a weak grip, I took Dr. Lasko\u2019s hand. My vocal cords were like sandpaper. \u201cI\u2019ll leave this place one day, doc.\u201d A single tear dripped from my chin onto my collarbone. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll ever be free.\u201d\n\nDr. Lasko didn\u2019t say a word, but I felt him squeeze my hand, just a little bit tighter.\n\nI licked the cracks on my lips as my eyes closed shut, imagining the oaky comfort of bourbon on my tongue. I felt myself drift, and good thing, because I needed the rest. Dr. Lasko and I would be delving into my memories again the following day.\n\nNo matter how masochistic it felt, I vowed to keep showing up for the simulations. Even if I never forgave myself for what I did, at least in my memories, I got to see Perry.","query":"How long has the narrator been sober for?","ground_truth":"The author had been sober for seven hundred and thirty days.","response_correct":"The narrator has been sober for two years.","response_wrong":"The narrator has been sober for just a few weeks."}
{"document_index":9,"context":"\u2018The Zone Of Interest\u2019 Ending Explained & Film Summary: What Happens To Rudolf And Hedwig Hoss?\nPUBLISHED\n\nFEBRUARY 21, 2024\nBY\nSOURYA SUR ROY\n0COMMENTS\nThe Zone Of Interest Ending Explained Film Summary Hedwig Ross, Rudolph Ross\nCredits: A24\nThe Zone of Interest is a new historical drama film by English filmmaker Jonathan Glazer that manages to recreate a terrible moment from history with a unique and devastating effect. Loosely adapted from Martin Amis\u2019 novel of the same name, the film\u2019s plot follows the Hoss family, who live right beside the Auschwitz concentration camp, going about their usual lives with no concern for the terrible crimes being committed right outside. The Zone of Interest is all about subtle, indirect expressions that are poignant enough to pierce through the visual layer, successfully making the viewer all the more uncomfortable with every passing minute.\n\nSpoiler Alert\n\nPlot Summary: What Is The Film About?\nThe Zone of Interest opens with a noticeably long black screen, with only a soft sound being eerily stretched in the background, perhaps preparing us for what is to unfold on screen over the next hundred or so minutes. When the visuals come on, though, there is nothing unusual or out of the ordinary, as a family is seen spending some personal time by the forested banks of a river. This is a secluded spot reserved only for the family, and it seems to be their most common way of spending leisure time. As the girls are led by a nanny through the bushes, possibly for some lesson in gardening and wildlife, the boys jump into the river along with their father. Sometime later, the family reunites and leaves the riverbank, driving away in two black, sinister-looking cars. On that very night, the father of the house is seen going around, switching off all the lights, before going to bed.\n\nWhile there is really nothing odd in this whole presentation of a family spending a day with themselves, the chilling reality of the matter is revealed when the film introduces the particular lot. The family is that of Rudolf Hoss, a notorious real figure from history, infamous for being a distinguished SS officer and the commander of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Most of the entire film, and the whole of the opening scene, actually takes place in Auschwitz, meaning that the leisurely picnic of the big family literally took place only a few miles away from the spot of the ongoing genocide. This is the very premise of The Zone of Interest, for it shows the tumultuous time of history from the perspective of the Hoss family, mainly the patriarch Rudolf and his wife, Hedwig.\n\nThe couple lives in an idyllic resort with their two sons and three daughters, the youngest still a baby, right on the other side of the high walls of the concentration camp. Despite the inhuman torture and killing going on right outside the walls that separate their lives, the Hoss family members are not perturbed by the matter at all. Instead, they are rather accustomed to Auschwitz, cherishing their time and accepting it as their new home.\n\nHow Does The Film Powerfully Present The Harrowing Events Of The Holocaust?\nThe most remarkable thing about The Zone of Interest is how it manages to say so much without directly saying it, combining the visual and the aural through a unique dissonance. With regards to the visuals, meaning scenes that play out to take forward the mostly simple and common story, the camera hardly ever leaves the confines of the host house. While some exceptions take place towards the latter part of the film, when Rudolf is transferred to a different concentration camp and he is seen at his new post, almost no scene of the camp in Auschwitz is seen. But the audio track picks up on numerous cries, lashes, and sounds that clearly come from the outside world but are heavily ignored. There is only one brief scene in which we are shown a side-angled close-up of Rudolf while he is at his workplace, which is a camp intended to kill Jews by the thousands. Indeed, the man is shot looking at the work he is rather proud of doing, amidst thick smoke bellowing out and loud cries and shrieks of helpless people. Rudolf certainly has no reservations about overseeing a genocide, but the film particularly shines with respect to how it uses the very usual to highlight the horrific context in the backdrop.\n\nEarly on in the film, Rudolf\u2019s family and his subordinates celebrate the man\u2019s birthday with a fancy cake, and all the Nazi soldiers come to his house to greet him. This merrymaking literally takes place all while hundreds, if not thousands, of families, are kept locked in the concentration camps and forced into the gas chambers. But nobody seems to notice, or rather, everyone pretends to look through the entire matter, as if nothing shocking is in the works. Rudolf is also seen meeting with a businessman in his house, who comes to show the commander plans and designs for a new, more effective gas chamber that he wants to build for his government. Rudolf goes through the plans without any hesitation and then also reports about this businessman\u2019s portfolio to his higher authorities, convinced that sturdier and better-designed gas chambers are needed to take his beloved nation and his government forward. The Zone of Interest does not really differentiate between evil-doers and those supporting such evil, but Rudolf is definitely in the first category, as he clearly enjoys the torture and killing of people.\n\nWhat comes as even a bigger shock is the reaction of his wife, Hedwig, for she does not react to any of these massacres either. Rather, the woman is extremely accustomed to the life of the commander\u2019s wife, and she enjoys the perks it brings along. She often receives luxury and expensive items that have been taken away from the prisoners, and on one particular occasion, she is seen receiving a fancy fur coat, since the Nazis did not differentiate between the rich and the poor among their targets. Hedwig immediately throws the coat on her body and tries it out in front of the mirror, only to realize that there is still lipstick lying inside one of the pockets. The presence of the lipstick would obviously be a bold reminder to anyone of the previous owner of the coat and the atrocious torture she must be subjected to at present. However, Hedwig has been wired to not think like that, and instead of any guilt or remorse, she feels rather excited to try on the lipstick, which is now hers as well.\n\nHedwig maintains a calm and composed nature, without any worry in the world, as she focuses on her gardening and getting a pool built for her children in their compound. The thick, dark smoke from the chimneys of the gas chambers on one side and from the steam engine train that brings in Jewish prisoners every day on the other does not affect the woman at all. The irony of the matter is all the more glaring when Hedwig is absolutely livid that her husband has to be transferred away from Auschwitz. She decides to stay back at the place along with her children because she is unwilling to uproot the life she had built there, including the fancy garden and the greenhouse, and shift somewhere else, which is probably too cold for her comfort as well. The fact that thousands were being faced with worse persecution and millions more would be uprooted, killed, or left disbanded very easily eludes her thought. In this regard, Jonathan Glazer\u2019s film is a really fascinating note on not just the Holocaust but also the effect of systematized violence and the tendency of the masses to side with the oppressors in any given scenario.\n\nThe Hoss children are also equally desensitized to seeing murder and killing around them. The boys play around with toy soldiers, all waging war against invisible enemies. Shockingly, they are also seen collecting and playing with gold teeth, which are literally the remains of people who had been killed in the camp. One of the daughters does seem to feel something odd about their house, or she simply sleepwalks as a habit and sits by the door as if waiting for someone to arrive. Nonetheless, this young girl would also grow accustomed to the situation one day and not find anything strange about it. The Jewish prisoners are allowed to get close to the house and the family, as many of them are given the task of cleaning the boots and bringing supplies to the place. But there is also a clear distinction that the Nazi commander maintains from them, which highlights the pure hatred breeding inside his perspective of the people. As soon as Rudolf finds a skull and some ashes in the river that he and his sons were bathing in, he scurries back to his house, and the children are scrubbed clean with utmost precision. In another instance, it is suggested that Rudolf forces himself upon a helpless prisoner woman, but he ensures that he scrubs his private parts before retiring for the night.\n\nThe only exception to the unaffected response by the entire family is by Hedwig\u2019s mother, who finds it bizarre that her daughter, her husband, and their children can really live at such a place. The elderly woman definitely has no sympathies for the prisoners, though, but she is rather unable to live with so many signs and reminders of death all around. The stench of burning human bodies and the ash flying around keep her up all night, but the very same elements are like playthings for the two young boys who still lay awake in their room. On a similar night, filled with reminders of the ongoing genocide, Hedwig is seen asking Rudolf to take her on a romantic trip, in the most romantic conversation between the couple in the film. Ultimately, the mother leaves the house unannounced very early the next morning, only leaving behind a note for her daughter. Hedwig simply tosses the note into her furnace insignificantly, almost insulted that someone would find her beloved home distasteful or discomforting. Even after Rudolf leaves for Oranienburg, Hedwig stays at their Auschwitz house with the children.\n\nWhat Do The Scenes In Infrared Signify?\nThe Zone of Interest also sparsely presents a few scenes, in which an unacquainted young girl is seen going around Auschwitz, hiding apples and other meager food items inside the trenches. She is clearly doing this extremely dangerous work only to help the prisoners and ease their suffering in whatever little way she can. But interestingly, these scenes are in infrared, or negative, although only as long as the girl is in the outside world. As soon as she returns home, the visuals turn normal, then switch to infrared when she or her mother step out on the balcony. The family is revealed to be Polish locals who have no interest in Nazi ideals and dream of liberation one day. However, the mere fact that the family is still alive, irrespective of whether they are Jewish or not, suggests that they also have to work as collaborators for the Nazis to a certain degree. This was definitely the case with numerous non-Jews during the Nazi occupation who had to work for the horrific authorities despite not wanting to. Going by that logic, the significance of the use of infrared might be in stating how the family cannot be themselves as soon as they step out of their house or into the open balcony as well. Although the girl takes on the dangerous responsibility of helping the prisoners, she still cannot express her true self in public, leading to her being shown in infrared. Another perspective is that the girl and her mother truly stand out in this horrific world solely because of their generous actions. Therefore, in a film like this, in which the Nazis and the enablers are the \u201cnormal\u201d people, anyone with any sense of humanity has to be visually differentiated from the Hoss family members.\n\nWhat Happens To Rudolf Hoss?\nDuring The Zone of Interest\u2018s ending, Rudolf is seen in his Berlin office as he telephones Hedwig and tells her about his excitement for the concentration camps being built. Rudolf had been given the responsibility of overseeing a new Nazi order in which Hungarian Jews were to be arrested and killed. Although Hedwig refuses to be part of this very direct talk of violence, for she prefers such matters to be in the background, the commander still feels thrilled. He is seen walking down the stairs from his office when suddenly bouts of violent retching hit him on two occasions. In the middle of these two instances, The Zone of Interest briefly moves to modern times, and various reminders of the Holocaust are seen being maintained at the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, right before the place is opened to public visitors. The last scene returns to the past once more, and Rudolf is seen feeling slightly odd, as if someone is watching him, as he continues down the stairs.\n\nThe Zone of Interest\u2018s ending scene seems to suggest that deep in his conscience, Rudolf Hoss does know that his actions can only make one retch, and almost like a fortune-teller, he has an uneasy feeling that his legacy will go down terribly in history. The scene of the museum is a fast jolt back to the right perspective, which had been missing throughout the film. Throughout the entire duration of The Zone of Interest, Rudolf, his family, and his professional associates had all been extremely invested in hiding the evidence and changing the narrative, but ultimately, the thousands of shoes or the torn, ragged uniforms still exist as reminders of the horrible genocide.","query":"Who is in the family that this film is about?","ground_truth":"The film takes the perspective of the Hoss family.

{"document_index":6,"context":"Why do we need to regulate the use of Artificial Intelligence?\nThe potential benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for our societies are manifold from improved medical care to better education. Faced with the rapid technological development of AI, the EU decided to act as one to harness these opportunities.\n\nThe EU AI Act is the world's first comprehensive AI law. It aims to address risks to health, safety and fundamental rights. The regulation also protects democracy, rule of law and the environment.\n\nWhile most AI systems will pose low to no risk, certain AI systems create risks that need to be addressed to avoid undesirable outcomes.\n\nFor example, the opacity of many algorithms may create uncertainty and hamper the effective enforcement of the existing legislation on safety and fundamental rights. Responding to these challenges, legislative action was needed to ensure a well-functioning internal market for AI systems where both benefits and risks are adequately addressed.\n\nThis includes applications such as biometric identification systems or AI decisions touching on important personal interests, such as in the areas of recruitment, education, healthcare, or law enforcement.\n\nRecent advancements in AI gave rise to ever more powerful Generative AI. So-called \u201cgeneral-purpose AI models\u201d that are being integrated in numerous AI systems are becoming too important for the economy and society not to be regulated. In light of potential systemic risks, the EU puts in place effective rules and oversight.\n\nWhich risks will the new AI rules address?\nThe uptake of AI systems has a strong potential to bring societal benefits, economic growth and enhance EU innovation and global competitiveness. However, in certain cases, the specific characteristics of certain AI systems may create new risks related to user safety and fundamental rights. Some powerful AI models that are being widely used could even pose systemic risks.\n\nThis leads to legal uncertainty for companies and potentially slower uptake of AI technologies by businesses and citizens, due to the lack of trust. Disparate regulatory responses by national authorities would risk fragmenting the internal market.\n\nTo whom does the AI Act apply?\nThe legal framework will apply to both public and private actors inside and outside the EU as long as the AI system is placed on the Union market or its use affects people located in the EU.\n\nIt can concern both providers (e.g. a developer of a CV-screening tool) and deployers of high-risk AI systems (e.g. a bank buying this screening toolImporters of AI systems will also have to ensure that the foreign provider has already carried out the appropriate conformity assessment procedure, bears a European Conformity (CE) marking and is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions of use.\n\nIn addition, certain obligations are foreseen for providers of general-purpose AI models, including large generative AI models.\n\nProviders of free and open-source models are exempted from most of these obligations. This exemption does not cover obligations for providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risks.\n\nObligations also do not apply to research, development and prototyping activities preceding the release on the market, and the regulation furthermore does not apply to AI systems that are exclusively for military, defence or national security purposes, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those activities.\n\nWhat are the risk categories?\nThe Commission proposes a risk\u2013based approach, with four levels of risk for AI systems, as well as an identification of risks specific to general purpose models:\n\nMinimal risk: All other AI systems can be developed and used subject to the existing legislation without additional legal obligations. The vast majority of AI systems currently used or likely to be used in the EU fall into this category. Voluntarily, providers of those systems may choose to apply the requirements for trustworthy AI and adhere to voluntary codes of conduct.\nHigh-risk: A limited number of AI systems defined in the proposal, potentially creating an adverse impact on people's safety or their fundamental rights (as protected by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights), are considered to be high-risk. Annexed to the Act is the list of high-risk AI systems, which can be reviewed to align with the evolution of AI use cases.\nThese also include safety components of products covered by sectorial Union legislation. They will always be considered high-risk when subject to third-party conformity assessment under that sectorial legislation.\nUnacceptable risk: A very limited set of particularly harmful uses of AI that contravene EU values because they violate fundamental rights and will therefore be banned:\nSocial scoring for public and private purposes;\nExploitation of vulnerabilities of persons, use of subliminal techniques;\nReal-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces by law enforcement, subject to narrow exceptions (see below);\nBiometric categorisation of natural persons based on biometric data to deduce or infer their race, political opinions, trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs or sexual orientation. Filtering of datasets based on biometric data in the area of law enforcement will still be possible;\nIndividual predictive policing;\nEmotion recognition in the workplace and education institutions, unless for medical or safety reasons (i.e. monitoring the tiredness levels of a pilot);\nUntargeted scraping of internet or CCTV for facial images to build-up or expand databases.\nSpecific Transparency risk: For certain AI systems specific transparency requirements are imposed, for example where there is a clear risk of manipulation (e.g. via the use of chatbots). Users should be aware that they are interacting with a machine.\nIn addition, the AI Act considers systemic risks which could arise from general-purpose AI models, including large generative AI models. These can be used for a variety of tasks and are becoming the basis for many AI systems in the EU. Some of these models could carry systemic risks if they are very capable or widely used. For example, powerful models could cause serious accidents or be misused for far-reaching cyberattacks. Many individuals could be affected if a model propagates harmful biases across many applications.\n\nHow do I know whether an AI system is high-risk?\nTogether with a clear definition of \u2018high-risk', the Act sets out a solid methodology that helps identifying high-risk AI systems within the legal framework. This aims to provide legal certainty for businesses and other operators.\n\nThe risk classification is based on the intended purpose of the AI system, in line with the existing EU product safety legislation. It means that the classification of the risk depends on the function performed by the AI system and on the specific purpose and modalities for which the system is used.\n\nAnnexed to the Act is a list of use cases which are considered to be high-risk. The Commission will ensure that this list is kept up to date and relevant. Systems on the high-risk list, that perform narrow procedural tasks, improve the result of previous human activities, do not influence human decisions or do purely preparatory tasks are not considered high-risk. However, an AI system shall always be considered high-risk if it performs profiling of natural persons.\n\nWhat are the obligations for providers of high-risk AI systems?\nBefore placing a high-risk AI system on the EU market or otherwise putting it into service, providers must subject it to a conformity assessment. This will allow them to demonstrate that their system complies with the mandatory requirements for trustworthy AI (e.g. data quality, documentation and traceability, transparency, human oversight, accuracy, cybersecurity and robustness). This assessment has to be repeated if the system or its purpose are substantially modified.\n\nAI systems being safety components of products covered by sectorial Union legislation will always be deemed high-risk when subject to third-party conformity assessment under that sectorial legislation. Also, for biometric systems a third-party conformity assessment is always required.\n\nProviders of high-risk AI systems will also have to implement quality and risk management systems to ensure their compliance with the new requirements and minimise risks for users and affected persons, even after a product is placed on the market.\n\nHigh-risk AI systems that are deployed by public authorities or entities acting on their behalf will have to be registered in a public EU database, unless those systems are used for law enforcement and migration. The latter will have to be registered in a non-public part of the database that will be only accessible to relevant supervisory authorities.\n\nMarket surveillance authorities will support post-market monitoring through audits and by offering providers the possibility to report on serious incidents or breaches of fundamental rights obligations of which they have become aware. Any market surveillance authority may authorise placing on the market of specific high-risk AI for exceptional reasons.\n\nIn case of a breach, the requirements will allow national authorities to have access to the information needed to investigate whether the use of the AI system complied with the law.\n\nWhat are examples for high-risk use cases as defined in Annex III?\nCertain critical infrastructures for instance in the fields of road traffic and the supply of water, gas, heating and electricity;\nEducation and vocational training, e.g. to evaluate learning outcomes and steer the learning process and monitoring of cheating;\nEmployment, workers management and access to self-employment, e.g. to place targeted job advertisements, to analyse and filter job applications, and to evaluate candidates;\nAccess to essential private and public services and benefits (e.g. healthcare), creditworthiness evaluation of natural persons, and risk assessment and pricing in relation to life and health insurance;\nCertain systems used in the fields of law enforcement, border control, administration of justice and democratic processes;\nEvaluation and classification of emergency calls;\nBiometric identification, categorisation and emotion recognition systems (outside the prohibited categories);\nRecommender systems of very large online platforms are not included, as they are already covered in other legislation (DMA\/DSA).\nHow are general-purpose AI models being regulated?\nGeneral-purpose AI models, including large generative AI models, can be used for a variety of tasks. Individual models may be integrated into a large number of AI systems.\n\nIt is important that a provider wishing to build upon a general-purpose AI model has all the necessary information to make sure its system is safe and compliant with the AI Act.\n\nTherefore, the AI Act obliges providers of such models to disclose certain information to downstream system providers. Such transparency enables a better understanding of these models.\n\nModel providers additionally need to have policies in place to ensure that that they respect copyright law when training their models.\n\nIn addition, some of these models could pose systemic risks, because they are very capable or widely used.\n\nFor now, general purpose AI models that were trained using a total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs are considered to carry systemic risks, given that models trained with larger compute tend to be more powerful. The AI Office (established within the Commission) may update this threshold in light of technological advances, and may furthermore in specific cases designate other models as such based on further criteria (e.g. number of users, or the degree of autonomy of the model).\n\nProviders of models with systemic risks are therefore mandated to assess and mitigate risks, report serious incidents, conduct state-of-the-art tests and model evaluations, ensure cybersecurity and provide information on the energy consumption of their models.\n\nFor this, they are asked to engage with the European AI Office to draw up Codes of Conduct as the central tool to detail out the rules in cooperation with other experts. A scientific panel will play a central role in overseeing general-purpose AI models.\n\nWhy is 10^25 FLOPs an appropriate threshold for GPAI with systemic risks?\nThis threshold captures the currently most advanced GPAI models, namely OpenAI's GPT-4 and likely Google DeepMind's Gemini.\n\nThe capabilities of the models above this threshold are not yet well enough understood. They could pose systemic risks, and therefore it is reasonable to subject their providers to the additional set of obligations.\n\nFLOP is a first proxy for model capabilities, and the exact FLOP threshold can be updated upwards or downwards by the European AI Office, e.g. in the light of progress in objectively measuring model capabilities and of developments in the computing power needed for a given performance level.\n\nThe AI Act can be amended to update the FLOP threshold (by means of a delegated act).\n\nIs the AI Act future-proof?\nThe Regulation introduces different level of risks and provides clear definitions, including for GPAI.\n\nThe legislation sets result-oriented requirements for high-risk AI systems but leaves the concrete technical solutions and operationalisation primarily to industry-driven standards that will ensure that the legal framework is flexible to be adapted to different use cases and to enable new technological solutions.\n\nIn addition, the AI Act can be amended by delegated and implementing acts, including to update the FLOP threshold (delegated act), to add criteria for classifying the GPAI models as presenting systemic risks (delegated act), to amend modalities to establish regulatory sandboxes and elements of the real-world testing plan (implementing acts).\n\nHow does the AI Act regulate biometric identification?\nThe use of real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces (i.e. facial recognition using CCTV) for law enforcement purposes is prohibited, unless used in one of the following cases:\n\nLaw enforcement activities related to 16 specified crimes;\nTargeted search for specific victims, abduction, trafficking and sexual exploitation of human beings, and missing persons; or\nThe prevention of threat to the life or physical safety of persons or response to the present or foreseeable threat of a terror attack.\nThe list of the 16 crimes contains:\n\nTerrorism;\nTrafficking in human beings;\nSexual exploitation of children and child sexual abuse material;\nIllicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances;\nIllicit trafficking in weapons, munitions and explosives;\nMurder;\nGrievous bodily injury;\nIllicit trade in human organs and tissue;\nIllicit trafficking in nuclear or radioactive materials;\nKidnapping, illegal restraint and hostage-taking;\nCrimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court;\nUnlawful seizure of aircraft\/ships;\nRape;\nEnvironmental crime;\nOrganised or armed robbery;\nSabotage, participation in a criminal organisation involved in one or more crimes listed above.\nReal-time remote biometric identification by law enforcement authorities would be subject to prior authorisation by a judicial or independent administrative authority whose decision is binding. In case of urgency, authorisation can be done within 24 hours; if the authorisation is rejected all data and output needs to be deleted.\n\nIt would need to be preceded by prior fundamental rights impact assessment and should be notified to the relevant market surveillance authority and the data protection authority. In case of urgency, the use of the system may be commenced without the registration.\n\nUsage of AI systems for post remote biometric identification (identification of persons in previously collected video material) of persons under investigation requires prior authorisation by a judicial authority or an independent administrative authority, and notification of the data protection and market surveillance authority.\n\nWhy are particular rules needed for remote biometric identification?\nBiometric identification can take different forms. It can be used for user authentication i.e. to unlock a smartphone or for verification\/authentication at border crossings to check a person's identity against his\/her travel documents (one-to-one matching).\n\nBiometric identification could also be used remotely, for identifying people in a crowd, where for example an image of a person is checked against a database (one-to-many matching).\n\nAccuracy of systems for facial recognition can vary significantly based on a wide range of factors, such as camera quality, light, distance, database, algorithm, and the subject's ethnicity, age or gender. The same applies for gait and voice recognition and other biometric systems. Highly advanced systems are continuously reducing their false acceptance rates.\n\nWhile a 99% accuracy rate may sound good in general, it is considerably risky when the result leads to the suspicion of an innocent person. Even a 0.1% error rate is a lot if it concerns tens of thousands of people.\n\nHow do the rules protect fundamental rights?\nThere is already a strong protection for fundamental rights and for non-discrimination in place at EU and Member State level, but complexity and opacity of certain AI applications (\u2018black boxes') pose a problem.\n\nA human-centric approach to AI means to ensure AI applications comply with fundamental rights legislation. Accountability and transparency requirements for the use of high-risk AI systems, combined with improved enforcement capacities, will ensure that legal compliance is factored in at the development stage.\n\nWhere breaches occur, such requirements will allow national authorities to have access to the information needed to investigate whether the use of AI complied with EU law.\n\nMoreover, the AI Act requires that deployers that are bodies governed by public law or private operators providing public services and operators providing high-risk systems to conduct a fundamental rights impact assessment.\n\nWhat is a fundamental rights impact assessment? Who has to conduct such an assessment, and when?\nThe use of a high-risk AI system may produce an impact on fundamental rights. Therefore, deployers that are bodies governed by public law or private operators providing public services, and operators providing high-risk systems shall perform an assessment of the impact on fundamental rights and notify the national authority of the results.\n\nThe assessment shall consist of a description of the deployer's processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used, of the period of time and frequency in which the high-risk AI system is intended to be used, of the categories of natural persons and groups likely to be affected by its use in the specific context, of the specific risks of harm likely to impact the affected categories of persons or group of persons, a description of the implementation of human oversight measures and of measures to be taken in case of the materialization of the risks.\n\nIf the provider already met this obligation through the data protection impact assessment, the fundamental rights impact assessment shall be conducted in conjunction with that data protection impact assessment.\n\nHow does this regulation address racial and gender bias in AI?\nIt is very important that AI systems do not create or reproduce bias. Rather, when properly designed and used, AI systems can contribute to reduce bias and existing structural discrimination, and thus lead to more equitable and non-discriminatory decisions (e.g. in recruitment).\n\nThe new mandatory requirements for all high-risk AI systems will serve this purpose. AI systems must be technically robust to guarantee that the technology is fit for purpose and false positive\/negative results are not disproportionately affecting protected groups (e.g. racial or ethnic origin, sex, age etc.).\n\nHigh-risk systems will also need to be trained and tested with sufficiently representative datasets to minimise the risk of unfair biases embedded in the model and ensure that these can be addressed through appropriate bias detection, correction and other mitigating measures.\n\nThey must also be traceable and auditable, ensuring that appropriate documentation is kept, including of the data used to train the algorithm that would be key in ex post investigations.\n\nCompliance system before and after they are placed on the market will have to ensure these systems are regularly monitored and potential risks are promptly addressed.\n\nWhen will the AI Act be fully applicable?\nFollowing its adoption by the European Parliament and the Council, the AI Act shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the official Journal. It will be fully applicable 24 months after entry into force, with a graduated approach as follows:\n\n6 months after entry into force, Member States shall phase out prohibited systems;\n12 months: obligations for general purpose AI governance become applicable;\n24 months: all rules of the AI Act become applicable including obligations for high-risk systems defined in Annex III (list of high-risk use cases);\n36 months: obligations for high-risk systems defined in Annex II (list of Union harmonisation legislation) apply.\nHow will the AI Act be enforced?\nMember States hold a key role in the application and enforcement of this Regulation. In this respect, each Member State should designate one or more national competent authorities to supervise the application and implementation, as well as carry out market surveillance activities.\n\nTo increase efficiency and to set an official point of contact with the public and other counterparts, each Member State should designate one national supervisory authority, which will also represent the country in the European Artificial Intelligence Board.\n\nAdditional technical expertise will be provided by an advisory forum, representing a balanced selection of stakeholders, including industry, start-ups, SMEs, civil society and academia.\n\nIn addition, the Commission will establish a new European AI Office, within the Commission, which will supervise general-purpose AI models, cooperate with the European Artificial Intelligence Board and be supported by a scientific panel of independent experts.\n\nWhy is a European Artificial Intelligence Board needed and what will it do?\nThe European Artificial Intelligence Board comprises high-level representatives of competent national supervisory authorities, the European Data Protection Supervisor, and the Commission. Its role is to facilitate a smooth, effective and harmonised implementation of the new AI Regulation.\n\nThe Board will issue recommendations and opinions to the Commission regarding high-risk AI systems and on other aspects relevant for the effective and uniform implementation of the new rules. Finally, it will also support standardisation activities in the area.\n\nWhat are the tasks of the European AI Office?\nThe AI Office has as its mission to develop Union expertise and capabilities in the field of artificial intelligence and to contribute to the implementation of Union legislation of artificial intelligence in a centralised structure.\n\nIn particular, the AI Office shall enforce and supervise the new rules for general purpose AI models. This includes drawing up codes of practice to detail out rules, its role in classifying models with systemic risks and monitoring the effective implementation and compliance with the Regulation. The latter is facilitated by the powers to request documentation, conduct model evaluations, investigate upon alerts and request providers to take corrective action.\n\nThe AI Office shall ensure coordination regarding artificial intelligence policy and collaboration between involved Union institutions, bodies and agencies as well as with experts and stakeholders. In particular, it will provide a strong link with the scientific community to support the enforcement, serve as international reference point for independent experts and expert organisations and facilitate exchange and collaboration with similar institutions across the globe.\n\nWhat is the difference between the AI Board, AI Office, Advisory Forum and Scientific Panel of independent experts?\nThe AI Board has extended tasks in advising and assisting the Commission and the Member States.\n\nThe AI Office is to be established within the Commission and shall work to develop Union expertise and capabilities in the field of artificial intelligence and to contribute to the implementation of Union legislation of artificial intelligence. Particularly, the AI Office shall enforce and supervise the new rules for general purpose AI models.\n\nThe Advisory Forum will consist of a balanced selection of stakeholders, including industry, start-ups, SMEs, civil society and academia. It shall be established to advise and provide technical expertise to the Board and the Commission, with members appointed by the Board among stakeholders.\n\nThe Scientific Panel of independent experts supports the implementation and enforcement of the Regulation as regards GPAI models and systems, and the Member States would have access to the pool of experts.\n\nWhat are the penalties for infringement?\nWhen AI systems are put on the market or in use that do not respect the requirements of the Regulation, Member States will have to lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties, including administrative fines, in relation to infringements and communicate them to the Commission.\n\nThe Regulation sets out thresholds that need to be taken into account:\n\nUp to \u20ac35m or 7% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) for infringements on prohibited practices or non-compliance related to requirements on data;\nUp to \u20ac15m or 3% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year for non-compliance with any of the other requirements or obligations of the Regulation, including infringement of the rules on general-purpose AI models;\nUp to \u20ac7.5m or 1.5% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year for the supply of incorrect, incomplete or misleading information to notified bodies and national competent authorities in reply to a request;\nFor each category of infringement, the threshold would be the lower of the two amounts for SMEs and the higher for other companies.\nIn order to harmonise national rules and practices in setting administrative fines, the Commission, counting on the advice of the Board, will draw up guidelines.\n\nAs EU Institutions, agencies or bodies should lead by example, they will also be subject to the rules and to possible penalties; the European Data Protection Supervisor will have the power to impose fines to them.\n\nWhat can individuals do that are affected by a rule violation?\nThe AI Act foresees a right to lodge a complaint with a national authority. On this basis national authorities can launch market surveillance activities, following the procedures of the market surveillance regulations.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed AI Liability Directive aims to provide persons seeking compensation for damage caused by high-risk AI systems with effective means to identify potentially liable persons and obtain relevant evidence for a damage claim. For this purpose, the proposed Directive provides for the disclosure of evidence about specific high-risk AI systems that are suspected of having caused damage.\n\nMoreover, the revised Product Liability Directive will ensure that compensation is available to individuals who suffer death, personal injury or property damage that is caused by a defective product in the Union and clarify that AI systems and products that integrate AI systems are also covered by existing rules.\n\nHow do the voluntary codes of conduct for high-risk AI systems work?\nProviders of non-high-risk applications can ensure that their AI system is trustworthy by developing their own voluntary codes of conduct or adhering to codes of conduct adopted by other representative associations.\n\nThese will apply simultaneously with the transparency obligations for certain AI systems.\n\nThe Commission will encourage industry associations and other representative organisations to adopt voluntary codes of conduct.\n\nHow do the codes of practice for general purpose AI models work?\nThe Commission invites providers of general-purpose AI models and other experts to jointly work on a code of practice.\n\nOnce developed and approved for this purpose, these codes can be used by the providers of general-purpose AI models to demonstrate compliance with the relevant obligations from the AI Act, following the example of the GDPR.\n\nThis is especially relevant to detail out the rules for providers of general-purpose AI model with systemic risks, to ensure future-proof and effective rules for risk assessment and mitigation as well as other obligations.\n\nDoes the AI Act contain provisions regarding environmental protection and sustainability?\nThe objective of the AI proposal is to address risks to safety and fundamental rights, including the fundamental right to a high-level environmental protection. Environment is also one of the explicitly mentioned and protected legal interests.\n\nThe Commission is asked to request European standardisation organisations a standardisation deliverable on reporting and documentation processes to improve AI systems resource performance, such as reduction of energy and other resources consumption of the high-risk AI system during its lifecycle, and on energy efficient development of general-purpose AI models.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission by two years after the date of application of the Regulation and every four years thereafter, is asked to submit a report on the review of the progress on the development of standardisation deliverables on energy efficient development of general-purpose models and asses the need for further measures or actions, including binding measures or actions.\n\nIn addition, providers of general purpose AI models, which are trained on large data amounts and therefore prone to high energy consumption, are required to disclose energy consumption.\n\nThe Commission is asked to develop an appropriate methodology for this assessment.\n\nIn case of general purpose AI models with systemic risks, energy efficiency furthermore needs to be assessed.\n\nHow can the new rules support innovation?\nThe regulatory framework can enhance the uptake of AI in two ways. On the one hand, increasing users' trust will increase the demand for AI used by companies and public authorities. On the other hand, by increasing legal certainty and harmonising rules, AI providers will access bigger markets, with products that users and consumers appreciate and purchase. Rules will apply only where strictly needed and in a way that minimises the burden for economic operators, with a light governance structure.\n\nThe AI Act further enables the creation of regulatory sandboxes and real world testing, which provide a controlled environment to test innovative technologies for a limited time, thereby fostering innovation by companies, SMEs and start-ups in compliance with the AI Act. These, together with other measures such as the additional Networks of AI Excellence Centres and the Public-Private Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, Data and Robotics, and access to Digital Innovation Hubs and Testing and Experimentation Facilities will help build the right framework conditions for companies to develop and deploy AI.\n\nReal world testing of High-Risk AI systems can be conducted for a maximum of 6 months (which can be prolonged by another 6 months). Prior to testing, a plan needs to be drawn up and submitted it to the market surveillance authority, which has to approve of the plan and specific testing conditions, with default tacit approval if no answer has been given within 30 days. Testing may be subject to unannounced inspections by the authority.\n\nReal world testing can only be conducted given specific safeguards, e.g. users of the systems under real world testing have to provide informed consent, the testing must not have any negative effect on them, outcomes need to be reversible or disregardable, and their data needs to be deleted after conclusion of the testing. Special protection is to be granted to vulnerable groups, i.e. due to their age, physical or mental disability.\n\nBesides the AI Act, how will the EU facilitate and support innovation in AI?\nThe EU's approach to Artificial Intelligence is based on excellence and trust, aiming to boost research and industrial capacity while ensuring safety and the protection of fundamental rights. People and businesses should be able to enjoy the benefits of AI while feeling safe and protected. The European AI Strategy aims at making the EU a world-class hub for AI and ensuring that AI is human-centric and trustworthy. In April 2021, the Commission presented its AI package, including: (1) a review of the Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence and (2) its proposal for a regulation laying down harmonised rules on AI.\n\nWith the Coordinated Plan on AI the European Commission has adopted a comprehensive strategy to promote the development and adoption of AI in Europe. It focuses on creating enabling conditions for AI development and uptake, ensuring excellence thrives from the lab to the market, increasing the trustworthiness of AI, and building strategic leadership in high-impact sectors.\n\nThe Commission aims to leverage the activities of Member States by coordinating and harmonizing their efforts, to foster a cohesive and synergistic approach towards AI development and adoption. The Commission also put in place the European AI Alliance platform, which brings together stakeholders from academia, industry, and civil society to exchange knowledge and insights on AI policies.\n\nMoreover, the Coordinated plans foresees several measures that aim to unlock data resources, foster critical computing capacity, increase research capacities, support a European network of Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFS) and support SMEs through European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs).\n\nWhat is the international dimension of the EU's approach?\nThe AI Act and the Coordinated Plan on AI are part of the efforts of the European Union to be a global leader in the promotion of trustworthy AI at international level. AI has become an area of strategic importance at the crossroads of geopolitics, commercial stakes and security concerns.\n\nCountries around the world are choosing to use AI as a way to signal their desires for technical advancement due to its utility and potential. AI regulation is only emerging and the EU will take actions to foster the setting of global AI standards in close collaboration with international partners in line with the rules-based multilateral system and the values it upholds. The EU intends to deepen partnerships, coalitions and alliances with EU partners (e.g. Japan, the US, India, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, or the Latin American and Caribbean region) as well as multilateral (e.g. OECD, G7 and G20) and regional organisations (e.g. Council of Europe).\n\n*Updated on 14\/12\/2023","query":"What kinds of AI carry \"systematic risks\"?","ground_truth":"For now, general purpose AI models that were trained using a total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs are considered to carry systemic risks, given that models trained with larger compute tend to be more powerful. The AI Office (established within the Commission) may update this threshold in light of technological advances, and may furthermore in specific cases designate other models as such based on further criteria (e.g. number of users, or the degree of autonomy of the model).","response_correct":"Currently, general-purpose AI models trained with more than 10^25 FLOPs are considered to pose systemic risks. The AI Office can also label other models as such based on factors like user numbers or autonomy.","response_wrong":"Systematic risks are carried only by AI systems used in critical infrastructure sectors like healthcare and transportation, regardless of how much computing power was used to train them."}

{"document_index":14,"context":"My eyes felt like galaxies\u2014holding the swirling glow of countless memories\u2014as I took in our childhood home. Its siding looked like remnants of driftwood after a bonfire. I swore I smelled the smoky char of pine creep into my nostrils. It\u2019s wild how the past stays with you like that. It can feel more visceral and real than the tangible things right in front of you.\n\n\u201cJesus, it feels like just yesterday.\u201d I placed a trembling hand over my heart, struggling to steady my breath.\n\nMy brother, Perry, pulled me into a tight embrace, his strength grounding me like an anchor.\n\n\u201cThe house hasn\u2019t changed much,\u201d he said, his voice steady and comforting. \u201cBut we have.\u201d His certainty made me question, Have I really changed?\n\nBetween the two of us, Perry was as solid and stoic as a mountain range. Good thing, because I was like the wind\u2014flighty and unpredictable. Over the years, Perry had learned to handle even my harshest hurricanes.\n\nBeing his older sister\u2014even if only by four minutes\u2014I always wished I\u2019d been his protector rather than the other way around. But that demon burning deep in my belly also flashed a crooked smile, knowing that Perry would never abandon me, especially since I got sober.\n\nI hadn\u2019t had a drink in exactly seven hundred and thirty days, and although it remained unsaid, I knew Perry was terrified of leaving me to my own devices in fear I would relapse.\n\nOur sibling bond was iron-clad. After we lost our parents in the fire (my mother didn\u2019t properly butt out her 2:00 am cigarette and well, the rest is history), all Perry and I had was each other. But let\u2019s call a spade a spade; we were also as fucked up and as co-dependent as it gets. Who mutually decides to visit the catalyst of your alcohol addiction on the anniversary of your sobriety?\n\nThe house\u2019s dilapidated front door creaked as Perry gently pushed it open. The rusted metal hinges were holding it up by a thread.\n\n\u201cAfter you.\u201d Perry gestured me in, squinting from the sunlight. He was a gentleman, even in such obscurity.\n\nAs he held the door open, the shallow scar on his right cheek taunted me like some kind of schoolyard bully. His wound often pulled me in like that. Some days, I was sure I would dive right into it and drown. Other days, I prayed to God and the Devil himself to just let me fucking drown, already.\n\nThat mark became permanently etched on Perry\u2019s face on the day I quit drinking, exactly seven hundred and thirty days ago. That was the day Perry screamed bloody murder at me from the passenger seat, \u201cJackie! Stop the fucking car!\u201d But my bloodstream was far too poisoned with Bacardi Limon to listen. All I remember next was my vehicle being wrapped around a tree. I could have died that day, but what truly disturbed me in the middle of the night was the fact that I almost killed Perry.\n\nA lot can happen in seven hundred and thirty days. But I assure you, forgiving yourself isn\u2019t one of them.\n\n\u201cWell? You coming in?\u201d Perry was still holding the door ajar.\n\nI shook it off and gave my brother a knowing glance. I swear, even though we were fraternal, we had twin telepathy. I exhaled and walked in.\n\n\u201cWatch your step,\u201d I warned, my forehead tense.\n\nI imagined the rickety floorboards collapsing, crashing us into what had once been our dad\u2019s \u201cman cave\u201d. That\u2019s where he was passed out, the night of the fire.\n\n\u201cKids, stay here. Do not move,\u201d our mother demanded after getting us out of the house safely. I remember the black soot on her face and the spiderweb veins in her eyes. She shook us firmly by the forearms. \u201cI\u2019m getting your father.\u201d\n\nPerry and I held each other, shaking. The heat from the inferno felt like standing in a volcano. We never saw our parents again.\n\nTwo decades later, there we were\u2014Perry and I\u2014-making our way through the wreckage of our home. It was midday, yet the inside of the house screamed a tone of pale blue midnight. My shoulders were up to my ears, as though we were walking through a haunted house attraction.\n\nI coughed into my forearm. The ocean of dust was thick like butter. As I cleared my lungs, Perry called out from behind me.\n\n\u201cJacks, look at this! The fireplace,\u201d Perry's voice was filled with awe.\n\n\u201cUnbelievable. It\u2019s still here,\u201d I whispered, a lump forming in my throat.\n\nIt was as though a Fairy Godmother breezed by and brought the decaying living room to life with her magical paintbrush. Kind of like in \u201cTitanic\u201d, when they showed the sunken ship underwater, versus in its prestige as it sailed across the Atlantic.\n\nWe made our way over to the fireplace and sat cross-legged on the floor.\n\n\u201cThis was our favorite spot, remember?\u201d I avoided his gaze, overwhelmed by the flood of memories.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Perry murmured, his eyes softening with nostalgia.\n\nFor a moment, the taste of crispy, fire roasted marshmallows superseded the saturated stench of mildew.\n\n\u201cRemember our s\u2019mores nights?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cDuh. What about all our fireplace movie nights?\u201d Perry proceeded to do his best, nasally, childhood impersonation of me, \u201cBut mom! I want to watch Beauty and the Beast!! Perry always gets to pick the movie!!\u201d\n\nI punched him in the arm, \u201cFirst of all, I never sounded like that. And second. So what? I knew what I wanted.\u201d\n\nThe corners of Perry\u2019s mouth lifted. He had such a sincere sparkle about him, as though a storm cloud of confetti followed him overhead wherever he went, \u201cYou really did, kiddo.\u201d\n\nMy chest went heavy. How could Perry love me after everything I had done? After all the relationships I\u2019d ruined? All the jobs I\u2019d lost? All of his relationships I\u2019d ruined? How could he still choose me, when so often I had chosen a forty of Jack Daniels over him?\n\nHow could Perry still love me after I almost fucking killed him?\n\nPerry\u2019s gaze widened, \u201cHey! Remember when Mom would bring out those hot drinks she always made?\u201d He paused, almost as if he was searching for the right term. \u201cApple\u2026 something? Apple ssshhh\u2026\u201d\n\nI snapped my fingers, \u201cApple-Schnapple!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, looking back it was basically just hot apple cider, but damn it was good.\u201d And it really was.\n\nOur laughs echoed throughout the abandoned asylum we once called home.\n\nPerry leaned back, holding himself up with his hands. \u201cI loved our fireplace hangs. Especially our movie nights down here. But nothing beats our movies up in the projector room.\u201d\n\nI tilted my head, \u201cWe never had a projector room.\u201d\n\nPerry playfully \u201cshoo\u2019d\u201d me away.\n\n\u201cNo. Perry. I would remember us having a projector room. Our movie nights together were our favorite thing. You even just said it yourself.\u201d\n\nThe house suddenly became pin-drop silent as Perry leaned in. \"Memories are quite something, aren\u2019t they?\" The slight shift in his tone made my skin crawl. Perry was always wistful, but this felt different, almost\u2026 clinical, \"We often remember things in ways that are\u2026 easier for us to digest.\"\n\nI was fidgety. \u201cGees Perry. You sound like Dr. Lasko.\u201d\n\nHe seemed to enjoy my little joke.\n\nDr. Lasko had been my therapist since the accident, and I would go out on a limb and say that he would not have approved of this self-inflicted exposure therapy I was subjecting myself to by visiting the house.\n\nPerry seemingly snapped out of his little therapist moment and went right back to being his sparkly confetti self. As I watched his amicable face scan the mantle above the fireplace, I felt a sickening uneasiness. Imagine you had actually fucking killed him.\n\n\u201cMan, I can still picture all our family photos up there,\u201d Perry\u2019s childlike wonder destroyed me.\n\nMy face went flush. I could feel the water rising in my eyes like the tides. How pathetic and infuriating was it that after everything I\u2019d done, I was still somehow the victim.\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d He took my hand.\n\n\u201cOh Perry,\u201d  I threw myself into him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nMy brother held me with his usual care that I didn\u2019t deserve.\n\n\u201cJacks, it\u2019s ok. I\u2019m still here. We\u2019re both still here.\u201d\n\nAs my chin rested on my brother\u2019s shoulder, I looked ahead of me at the remains of the house. Something felt off, and it wasn\u2019t just the overall unsettling environment. My brow furrowed. \u201cWasn\u2019t the doorway to the kitchen on the other side of the living room?\u201d\n\nI felt Perry shrug, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nI was staring into the out of place doorway like I was trying to pull a recollection towards me. And that\u2019s when I saw them in the kitchen: the translucent memory of mom and dad. Mom was getting our Apple-Schnapples ready. She was pacing, unlike Dad, who was sitting motionless at the table. His face was planted on its mahogany surface. His glass of Apple-Schnapple was empty, and so was the bottle of Jim Beam beside it.\n\nMom floated into the living room, our warm beverages in hand and a cigarette in her mouth, \u201cKids, your father\u2019s not feeling well. Let\u2019s have our Apple-Schnapples in here.\u201d\n\nOh my God. The bruise on her face.\n\nPerry jarred me back to reality with the gut punch of what he had to say next, \u201cYou\u2019re remembering the truth about mom and dad, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI pushed myself off and away from him. \u201cHow did you\u2026\u201d\n\nMy brother looked down, delicately tracing the floor with his finger, \u201cWe always put them on a pedestal after they died.\u201d\n\nI felt a shiver run down my spine, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\nAs Perry continued to speak, his words grew even more detached. \"Do you remember that first drink Dad ever gave you?\"\n\nMy eyes darted around the room as my jugular pulsed in my neck. As much as I tried to escape what Perry had just said, I did remember.\n\nI could hear my dad\u2019s slurring words of encouragement, \u201cCome on, Jackie. Just one drink. It\u2019ll be our special time, just you and me.\u201d\n\nThe bitterness of that first sip of beer made me squirm, but sharing a \u201cspecial time\u201d with my dad\u2014and the desperate yearning that maybe he did love me, afterall\u2014was the overwhelm of the full moon swallowing me whole. I was only a child, and much like how my mom turned a blind eye to my father\u2019s drinking, she did the exact same when it came to her daughter.\n\nI\u2019d used the death of my parents as the excuse for my alcoholism for so long, because admitting that they helped create the monster I would eventually become was like a knife to the heart. And knowing I had been too weak to conquer the addiction from my own volition just made the weapon twist in my chest.\n\nThe room was spinning. My face was blistering hot like the night of the fire. Or was that the warm heat from the fireplace when we were kids? The childhood fireplace memories ran through my mind, frame by frame, until\u2026..they eventually vaporized to nothing. I crouched over, thinking I might vomit.\n\n\u201cWe never had a fireplace.\u201d Perry was nodding, very matter-of-factly.\n\nMy fingernails dug into my thighs when I looked at the fireplace and: it was gone. Only a blank wall of faded, forest green wallpaper remained. Our house was once on fire, yes, but that was it. There was never a happy childhood fireplace. Ever.\n\nMy hands were cold and clammy. I fell back onto the wall behind me. \u201cPerry. Where are we?\u201d\n\nHe stood up and glided towards the staircase. One hand on the banister, his footsteps creaked, one by one, as he made his way to the second floor.\n\nMy mouth was bone dry, \u201cPerry!\u201d\n\nHe stopped and turned towards me, \u201cCome to the projector room. We love watching movies together, don\u2019t we? There\u2019s a movie I\u2019d like to show you.\u201d\n\nAs my brother disappeared from sight, I did what any classic horror movie trope would tell you to do: I went upstairs.\n\nI found Perry standing at the end of the ominous hallway. Large, empty picture frames lined the oxblood walls leading up to him. Through the doorway where Perry stood, particles in the air danced in the projector\u2019s cone-shaped light. That telltale winding of a film reel was the only sound in the deafening quiet of this house that I no longer recognized.\n\nHalf of Perry\u2019s face\u2014the one with the scar\u2014was perfectly illuminated, as though he was wearing the mask from \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera\u201d. \u201cI think you\u2019re ready to see how this movie ends, Jackie. This is the most progress you\u2019ve made since we\u2019ve been coming here.\u201d\n\nI gripped my thumbs in the palms of my hands, \u201cPerry, you\u2019re freaking the fuck out of me!\u201d\n\nI thought my knees might buckle as my brother\u2019s face glitched, like a flash of static snow on a television set. As his face settled back to normal to a deadpan gaze, he disappeared in the innocuous room. I followed, running on nothing but fumes.\n\nClutching the doorway, my mouth fell agape. Perry was gone. I darted to the middle of the room.\n\nAs I frantically searched for my brother, I shielded my eyes with the back of my hand from the projector\u2019s light. And that\u2019s when, from behind me, I heard five words that made my blood run cold, \u201cJackie! Stop the fucking car!\u201d\n\nI was convulsing yet paralyzed. Moving as slowly as cold molasses, I rotated on the spot towards my worst nightmare, shown on 35 mm. On the projector screen was Perry and me in my car, exactly seven hundred and thirty days ago, the day I almost kill\u2014\n\nOh my God.\n\nMy head pounded as fragmented memories surged. The reality of what happened began to crystallize, unrelenting.\n\nMy joints ached and my stomach churned. Clamping a hand over my mouth to stifle a scream, I stumbled down the hallway as it began caving in on itself. The picture frames were sucked into the walls. The floorboards cracked into distorted peaks and valleys. Wooden beams swung down from the ceiling like pendulums. I tried to spit out the chalky grit of disintegrating drywall that made the hallway look like a winter squall.\n\nPanting heavily, I stopped dead in my tracks at the stained glass window. My body trembled with an all-too-familiar dread. Each time I faced this, I wondered if this fall would be the one that would finally end it all.\n\nMaybe it\u2019d be better if it did.\n\nHolding my breath, I threw myself through the glass, my hands clawing the air for dear life. Free falling two stories feels like an eternity when you\u2019re watching the memory of your childhood home fall apart before your very eyes. But when the weight of my body finally made contact with the earth I\u2014\n\nI gasped. The cold air of the hospital room shocked my lungs. I sat up, ripping the suction cups from my face and body. My gown was clinging to me, soaked in sweat. Medical equipment beeped all around me like a metronome.\n\nDr. Lasko, my therapist since the accident, sat across the stark white room, sighing as he rubbed his forehead. He, too, was connected to a plethora of suction cups and wires. He looked a little worn out in the fluorescent overhead lighting. Ever since I was hospitalized and later incarcerated, Dr. Lasko had been helping me delve into my memories, namely the ones that were too excruciating for me to face. And as such, Dr. Lasko had been appearing in the simulations as my brother Perry, the love of my life who died in the car crash, seven hundred and thirty days prior.\n\nDisoriented, I blinked rapidly, the vividness of the memory contrasting sharply with the sterile, geometric ceiling tiles above me.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to do that again!\u201d I was venomous.\n\n\u201cJackie,\u201d Dr. Lasko started.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d I pulled up four fingers for air quotes, \u201c\u2018Jackie, don\u2019t give up. This was the closest you\u2019ve ever come to facing the truth.\u201d\n\nAs the initial burst of adrenal and cortisol left my body, I fell back on my pillow. I was depleted. Quiet rivers flowed down my cheeks.\n\nRemoving his own suction cups, Dr. Lasko approached my bedside and took a seat. He treaded lightly. \u201cJackie, I understand how challenging this is for you, but you did an incredible job today. If we continue making progress like this, there's a real possibility you'll gain your freedom sooner.\u201d\n\nI looked at the well-meaning doctor, but all I could see was Perry. Multicolored confetti fell softly around him like that first November snow. His face was the sun. His eyes reflected the whole world back to me.\n\nPerry.\n\nWith a weak grip, I took Dr. Lasko\u2019s hand. My vocal cords were like sandpaper. \u201cI\u2019ll leave this place one day, doc.\u201d A single tear dripped from my chin onto my collarbone. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll ever be free.\u201d\n\nDr. Lasko didn\u2019t say a word, but I felt him squeeze my hand, just a little bit tighter.\n\nI licked the cracks on my lips as my eyes closed shut, imagining the oaky comfort of bourbon on my tongue. I felt myself drift, and good thing, because I needed the rest. Dr. Lasko and I would be delving into my memories again the following day.\n\nNo matter how masochistic it felt, I vowed to keep showing up for the simulations. Even if I never forgave myself for what I did, at least in my memories, I got to see Perry.","query":"How is the narrator related to Perry","ground_truth":"Perry is the narrator's brother.","response_correct":"Perry is her sibling.","response_wrong":"Perry is her childhood friend."}
