    "**Azure AI Evaluation SDK's** `Simulator` provides an end-to-end synthetic data generation capability to help developers test their application's response to typical user queries in the absence of production data. AI developers can use an index or text-based query generator and fully customizable simulator to create robust test datasets around non-adversarial tasks specific to their application. The `Simulator` class is a powerful tool designed to generate synthetic conversations and simulate task-based interactions. This capability is useful for:\n",
    "- **Testing Conversational Applications**: Ensure your chatbots and virtual assistants respond accurately under various scenarios.\n",
    "- **Training AI Models**: Generate diverse datasets to train and fine-tune machine learning models.\n",
    "- **Generating Datasets**: Create extensive conversation logs for analysis and development purposes.\n",
    "By automating the creation of synthetic data, the Simulator class helps streamline the development and testing processes, ensuring your applications are robust and reliable.\n",

       "    'content': 'Leonardo da Vinci\\'s artistic achievements are truly remarkable, and his paintings are celebrated for their innovation and mastery. Two of his most famous works are \"The Last Supper\" and \"Mona Lisa.\"\\n\\n\"The Last Supper,\" painted between 1495 and 1498, is a mural located in the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. What makes this painting unique is Leonardo\\'s use of perspective and composition to create a dramatic narrative moment. He captures the moment Jesus announces that one of his disciples will betray him, and the reactions of the apostles are vividly portrayed. Leonardo\\'s use of light and shadow, as well as his attention to detail, make this work a masterpiece of Renaissance art.\\n\\nThe \"Mona Lisa,\" painted between 1503 and 1506, is perhaps the most famous painting in the world. It is renowned for the subject\\'s enigmatic expression, which seems to change when viewed from different angles. Leonardo\\'s use of sfumato, a technique that creates a soft transition between colors and tones, gives the painting a lifelike quality. The background landscape is also notable for its atmospheric perspective, adding depth to the composition.\\n\\nBoth paintings showcase Leonardo\\'s skill in capturing human emotion and his innovative techniques that have influenced countless artists. Is there a particular aspect of his art that you\\'d like to delve deeper into?',\n",

       "    'content': 'Sfumato is a fascinating technique that Leonardo da Vinci mastered, and it\\'s one of the reasons the \"Mona Lisa\" is so captivating. The term \"sfumato\" comes from the Italian word \"fumo,\" meaning smoke, and it describes a way of blending colors and tones so seamlessly that there are no harsh lines or edges. This creates a soft, almost smoky effect that gives the painting a lifelike and three-dimensional quality.\\n\\nLeonardo achieved this effect by applying multiple thin layers of translucent paint, allowing the colors to gradually transition into one another. This meticulous process required patience and precision, as it involved building up the layers slowly to achieve the desired depth and subtlety.\\n\\nThe significance of sfumato in art history lies in its revolutionary approach to realism. Before Leonardo, artists often used more defined lines and contrasts. Sfumato allowed for a more natural representation of light and shadow, enhancing the emotional and atmospheric qualities of a painting. This technique influenced many artists who followed, contributing to the evolution of portraiture and landscape painting.\\n\\nLeonardo\\'s use of sfumato in the \"Mona Lisa\" is particularly notable in the soft contours of her face and the mysterious quality of her expression, which seems to change depending on the viewer\\'s perspective. It\\'s a testament to his genius and his ability to capture the complexity of human emotion. Would you like to explore more about Leonardo\\'s techniques or perhaps another aspect of his work?',\n",

       "   'original_text': \"Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452 - 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect. While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he has also become known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and palaeontology. Leonardo is widely regarded to have been a genius who epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works comprise a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary Michelangelo.\\nBorn out of wedlock to a successful notary and a lower-class woman in, or near, Vinci, he was educated in Florence by the Italian painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio. He began his career in the city, but then spent much time in the service of Ludovico Sforza in Milan. Later, he worked in Florence and Milan again, as well as briefly in Rome, all while attracting a large following of imitators and students. Upon the invitation of Francis I, he spent his last three years in France, where he died in 1519. Since his death, there has not been a time where his achievements, diverse interests, personal life, and empirical thinking have failed to incite interest and admiration, making him a frequent namesake and subject in culture.\\nLeonardo is identified as one of the greatest painters in the history of Western art and is often credited as the founder of the High Renaissance. Despite having many lost works and fewer than 25 attributed major works – including numerous unfinished works – he created some of the most influential paintings in the Western canon. The Mona Lisa is his best known work and is the world's most famous individual painting. The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time and his Vitruvian Man drawing is also regarded as a cultural icon. In 2017, Salvator Mundi, attributed in whole or part to Leonardo, was sold at auction for US$450.3 million, setting a new record for the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.\\nRevered for his technological ingenuity, he conceptualised flying machines, a type of armoured fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, a ratio machine that could be used in an adding machine, and the double hull. Relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime, as the modern scientific approaches to metallurgy and engineering were only in their infancy during the Renaissance. Some of his smaller inventions, however, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire. He made substantial discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, hydrodynamics, geology, optics, and tribology, but he did not publish his findings and they had little to no direct influence on subsequent science.\"},\n",
